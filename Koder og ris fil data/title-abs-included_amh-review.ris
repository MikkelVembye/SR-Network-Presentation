AB  - CONTEXTResearch into the relationship between pregnancy intention and perinatal depression or low social support is limited. Women's perspectives on pregnancy and their associations with perinatal depression could help in developing targeted efforts for screening and intervention.METHODSIn 2014–2015, 161 women seeking pregnancy testing or abortion care at clinics in New Haven, Connecticut, were surveyed. They were asked about pregnancy context (intentions, planning, wantedness, desirability, timing and happiness), and the Edinburgh Depression Screen (EDS) and the Modified Kendler Social Support Index (MKSSI) were used to identify possible antenatal depression and low social support, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to examine associations between pregnancy context and these outcomes.RESULTSOn average, participants were 27 years old and at nine weeks’ gestation. One‐fifth reported a previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and 22% and 33% screened positive for depression (EDS scores of 13 or higher and 10 or higher, respectively); 52% received low social support (MKSSI score of 3.2 or less). Regression analysis found that pregnancies described as unintended, poorly timed or undesired were associated with depression at the higher cutoff (odds ratios, 3.2–4.5); all unfavorable pregnancy measures were associated with depression at the lower cutoff. Ambivalence regarding pregnancy timing, intention, wantedness and desirability was associated with increased odds of depression by either EDS score. Unplanned pregnancies and those about which the woman was ambivalent were associated with low social support.CONCLUSIONSFindings support the need to screen women for depression early in pregnancy and to integrate assessments of pregnancy context into the evaluation of potential risk factors.

AB  - Purpose Teenage motherhood is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity. However, the long-term consequences of teenage induced abortion on psychiatric morbidity remain unknown. We, therefore, examined the association between adolescent pregnancy and psychiatric morbidity according to pregnancy outcome (induced abortion vs. childbirth) and age (<20 or <18 years) at the beginning of a pregnancy. Methods We used Finnish health care registers to evaluate the risk of psychiatric morbidity following teenage induced abortion (n = 6,520) or childbirth (n = 6,806) using Poisson regression analysis. The mean follow-up time was 26.4 years. Age-matched girls without a teenage pregnancy (n = 39,429) served as the reference group. Results The risk of psychiatric morbidity was higher in the teenage abortion group compared with those without a teenage pregnancy, but this risk increased only at 5 years postabortion. We found no difference in psychiatric morbidity between the teenage pregnancy groups aged <20 years (induced abortion vs. childbirth). However, women who underwent an abortion at <18 years of age instead of childbirth faced a lower risk of psychiatric morbidity, particularly during the first 5 years postabortion. Conclusions Pregnant adolescents faced an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity in adulthood regardless of the outcome (induced abortion or childbirth) of the pregnancy. Among girls aged <18 years, the risk of mental disorders was lower following abortion compared with childbirth. This finding should be acknowledged when counseling pregnant adolescents and organizing family planning services for teenagers.

AB  - BackgroundAdolescent girls who become pregnant demonstrate greater risk for substance use than same‐aged peers. However, it remains unclear how risk relates to normative changes in adolescence. Few studies have examined adolescent substance use changes before, during, and after pregnancy and considered how pregnancy outcomes (childbirth, miscarriage, abortion) differentially influence substance use changes. The present study examined associations between different adolescent pregnancy outcomes andwithin‐personchanges in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy.MethodsParticipants included 2,450 girls (52% Black) oversampled from low‐income urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh,PA. Participants self‐reported pregnancy outcomes and substance use frequency (alcohol, cigarette, marijuana) annually from ages 11–20. Fixed effects regressions focused on first births, first miscarriages, and first abortions occurring from ages 12–19 to test the associations between pregnancy outcomes and within‐individual changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. By design, models controlled for all potential time‐stable confounds, and models included age and subsequent pregnancies as time‐varying covariates.ResultsConsistent with prior studies, girls who became pregnant (20%) reported greater early risk for substance use problems than never‐pregnant adolescents, including earlier age of onset and more regular marijuana and cigarette use. Childbirth predicted a 26%–51% within‐individual reduction in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use that remained significantly lower than prepregnancy levels after childbirth. Alcohol and marijuana use decreased (32%–47%) after miscarriage. Abortion was not associated with long‐term changes in substance use; however, marijuana and cigarette use gradually increased (44%–46%) in the years leading up to the year of and after abortion, respectively, before returning to prepregnancy levels.ConclusionsFindings highlight important differences in adolescent substance use patterns based on pregnancy outcome. For pregnant adolescents with heightened pre‐existing risk for substance use, pregnancy may be a window of opportunity for substance use screening and behavioral intervention.

AB  - Objective: Research on effects of pregnancy termination on women’s alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use suffers from methodological and conceptual problems. Improving on prior methodologies, this study examines changes in ATOD use over 5 years among women seeking terminations. Method: Data are from the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study of 956 women seeking terminations at 30 U.S. facilities. Participants presented just below a facility’s gestational limit and received terminations (Near-Limits) or just beyond the limit and were denied terminations (Turnaways). Using mixed-effects logistic regression, we assessed differences in ATOD use over 5 years among Near-Limits and Turnaways. Results: There were no differences in ATOD use before pregnancy recognition; 1 week after termination seeking, Turnaways had lower odds than Near-Limits of any and heavy episodic alcohol use (p < .001), but not alcohol problem symptoms, tobacco use, or other drug use. Although both groups increased in any alcohol use over time, Turnaways increased more rapidly. Neither group increased any other ATOD measures over time. Turnaways’ lower odds of heavy episodic alcohol use at 1 week after termination seeking were maintained throughout the subsequent 5 years. There was no differential change in problem alcohol use or in tobacco or other drug use over time, yet fewer Turnaways than Near-Limits reported problem alcohol symptoms 6 months through 3.5 years. Conclusions: There is no indication that terminating a pregnancy led women to increase heavy episodic or problem alcohol use or to increase tobacco or other drug use. Women denied terminations had temporary or sustained reductions in all alcohol measures, but not tobacco or other drugs, suggesting that relationships between pregnancy/parenting and ATOD differ across substances.

TI  - Abortion and subsequent depressive symptoms: an analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
AU  - Gomez, A  M
PY  - 2018
PD  - 
AB  - BackgroundTwenty states currently require that women seeking abortion be counseled on possible psychological responses, with six states stressing negative responses. The majority of research finds that women whose unwanted pregnancies end in abortion do not subsequently have adverse mental health outcomes; scant research examines this relationship for young women.MethodsFour waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed. Population-averaged lagged logistic and linear regression models were employed to test the relationship between pregnancy resolution outcome and subsequent depressive symptoms, adjusting for prior depressive symptoms, history of traumatic experiences, and sociodemographic covariates. Depressive symptoms were measured using a nine-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Analyses were conducted among two subsamples of women whose unwanted first pregnancies were resolved in either abortion or live birth: (1) 856 women with an unwanted first pregnancy between Waves 2 and 3; and (2) 438 women with an unwanted first pregnancy between Waves 3 and 4 (unweighted n's).ResultsIn unadjusted and adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses for both subsamples, there was no association between having an abortion after an unwanted first pregnancy and subsequent depressive symptoms. In fully adjusted models, the most recent measure of prior depressive symptoms was consistently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms.ConclusionsIn a nationally representative, longitudinal dataset, there was no evidence that young women who had abortions were at increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms compared with those who give birth after an unwanted first pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of alcohol use among women attending Antenatal Care in Gedeo zone rural health centers (Southern Ethiopia). This was a cross‐sectional study conducted among randomly selected 718 pregnant women attending Antenatal Care. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test‐C was used to assess alcohol consumption. Variables with p‐values of < 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression were considered as having a statistically significant association with alcohol use. RESULTS: The prevalence of alcohol use among pregnant women attending antenatal care service was 8.1% with 95% CI (6.3‐10.0). Unplanned pregnancy [AOR = 2.12, 95% CI (1.20, 3.73)], abortion history [AOR = 2.40, 95% CI (1.16, 4.96)], pre pregnancy alcohol use [AOR 2.17, 95% CI (1.18, 4.00)] and mental distress [AOR = 3.50, 95% CI (1.99, 6.15)] were variables found to have a statistically significant association with alcohol use. This calls a holistic and multi modal approach for the prevention, early identification and intervention of alcohol use during pregnancy. More emphasis should also be given for pregnant women with unplanned pregnancy, history of abortion, pre pregnancy alcohol use and mental distress.

AB  - Introduction: Substance use during pregnancy contributes to the risk of adverse health outcomes in mothers and children—in utero and during later development. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of substance use and associated factors in pregnant women receiving antenatal care in public hospitals in Thailand. Methods: Women (3578) attending 7 antenatal care clinics in Songkhla for the first time during their current pregnancy were interviewed with a structured questionnaire focusing on demographic data, obstetric history, use of alcohol, tobacco, and other substances, and the General Health Questionnaire was administered. The use of substances was confirmed with the ultrarapid version of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test and urine tests, which were also administered to 1 in 5 to 10 randomly selected women whose screening results were negative. Results: Based on self‐reports and General Health Questionnaire results, the weighted prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substance use and that of “mental health problems” were 5.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9‐6.4) and 29.2% (95% CI, 27.5‐30.9), respectively. On the basis of the ultrarapid version of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test and urine tests, the prevalence of likely substance use disorder during the 3 months prior to assessment was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.8‐1.5) and 7.7% (95% CI, 4.6‐10.7), respectively. Factors associated with substance use were religion, unmarried status, unplanned pregnancy, previous abortion, and current mental health problem. Discussion: Our results emphasize the need for identification of substance use and mental health problems, with the help of questionnaires and biological markers, followed by early intervention.

Women with a first documentation of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder in one of 281 gynecological practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017 were included in this study (index date). Controls without depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder were matched (1:1) to cases by age, index year, and physician. A total of 57,770 women were included in the present study. The main outcome of the study was the risk of psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, somatoform disorder) as a function of induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility.Results: The mean age was 29.2 years (SD = 6.4 years) in women with and without psychiatric disorders. Induced abortion (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 1.75 to 2.01), spontaneous abortion (ORs ranging from 2.16 to 2.60), and infertility (OR = 2.13) were positively associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders.Conclusions: A positive relationship between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and psychiatric disorders was observed in gynecological practices in Germany.

AB  - Suicide has been identified as one of the most common causes of death among women within 1 year after the end of pregnancy in several high-income countries. The aim of this study was to provide the first estimate of the maternal suicide ratio and a description of the characteristics of women who died by suicide during pregnancy or within 1 year after giving birth, induced abortion or miscarriage (i.e., maternal suicide) in 10 Italian regions, covering 77% of total national births. Maternal suicides were identified through the linkage between regional death registries and hospital discharge databases. Background population data was collected from the national hospital discharge, abortion and mortality databases. The previous psychiatric history of the women who died by maternal suicide was retrieved from the regionally available data sources. A total of 67 cases of maternal suicide were identified, corresponding to a maternal suicide ratio of 2.30 per 100,000 live births in 2006–2012. The suicide rate was 1.18 per 100,000 after giving birth (n = 2,876,193), 2.77 after an induced abortion (n = 650,549) and 2.90 after a miscarriage (n = 379,583). The majority of the women who died by maternal suicide (34/57) had a previous psychiatric history; 15/18 previously diagnosed mental disorders were not registered along with the index pregnancy obstetric records. Suicide is a relevant cause of maternal death in Italy. The continuity of care between primary, mental health and maternity care were found to be critical. Clinicians should be aware of the issue, as they may play an important role in preventing suicide in their patients.

AB  - Background: Depression during pregnancy, the most prevalent mental health problem, can alter fetal development and has important consequences on the offspring's physical and mental health. Evidence suggests increasing rates of prevalence of depression in low-income settings such as Ethiopia. However, there are a few studies on the topic with inconsistent results. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of antenatal depression and its correlates among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the West Shoa zone, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia, from February 20, 2018, to March 20, 2018. Pregnant women were recruited by using cluster sampling techniques. Data on socio-demographic, obstetric, and psychosocial characteristics were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression during pregnancy. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were fitted to identify correlates of depression. The level of statistical significance was declared at p value < 0.05. Results: The mean age (± SD) of the pregnant women was 28.41 ± 5.9 years. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy was 32.3%. When we adjusted for possible confounding variables in the final model; those pregnant mothers with an average monthly income of less than 500 (18 USD) Ethiopian birr [AOR = 3.19, 95% CI (1.47, 6.96)], unplanned pregnancy [AOR = 1.52, 95% CI (1.04, 2.21)] and having history of abortion [AOR = 5.13, 95% CI (2.42, 10.85)] have higher odds of depression when compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression during pregnancy was high. Strengthening the counseling service as well as increasing access and availability of modern contraceptive methods may reduce the rates of unplanned pregnancy in Ethiopia and this, in turn, plays a significant role in alleviating a resultant depression. Further, the integration of mental health services with existing maternal health care as well as strengthening the referral system among public health centers was warranted to minimize antenatal depression in the West Shoa zone health facilities.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of receiving compared with being denied an abortion on women's experiences of suicidal ideation over 5 years.Method: The authors recruited 956 women from 30 U.S. abortion facilities. Women were interviewed by telephone 1 week after their abortion visit, then every 6 months for 5 years. Women who received near-limit abortions were compared with women who were denied an abortion and carried their pregnancies to term (turnaway-birth group). Women completed the suicidal ideation items on the Brief Symptom Interview (BSI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale was used to assess imminent suicidality. Adjusted mixed-effects regression analyses accounting for clustering by site and individual were used to assess whether levels and trajectories of suicidality differed by group.Results: One week after abortion seeking, 1.9% of the near-limit group and 1.3% of the turnaway-birth group reported any suicidal ideation symptoms on the BSI. Over the 5-year study period, the proportion of women with any suicidal ideation symptoms on the BSI declined significantly to 0.25% for women in the near-limit group and nonsignificantly to 0.21% for those in the turnaway-birth group. In four out of 7,247 observations (0.06%), women reported being imminently suicidal. There was no statistically significant differential loss to follow-up by baseline report of suicidal ideation or history of depression or anxiety. There were no statistically significant group differences on any suicidal ideation outcome over the 5-year study period.Conclusions: Levels of suicidal ideation were similarly low between women who had abortions and women who were denied abortions. Policies requiring that women be warned that they are at increased risk of becoming suicidal if they choose abortion are not evidence based.

AB  - Importance: The repercussions of abortion for mental health have been used to justify state policies that limit access to abortion in the United States. Much earlier research has relied on self-report of abortion or mental health conditions or on convenience samples. This study uses data that rely on neither.Objective: To examine whether first-trimester first abortion or first childbirth is associated with an increase in women's initiation of a first-time prescription for an antidepressant.Design, Setting, and Participants: This study linked data and identified a cohort of women from Danish population registries who were born in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 30, 1994. Overall, 396 397 women were included in this study; of these women, 30 834 had a first-trimester first abortion and 85 592 had a first childbirth.Main Outcomes and Measure: First-time antidepressant prescription redemptions were determined and used as indication of an episode of depression or anxiety, and incident rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated comparing women who had an abortion vs women who did not have an abortion and women who had a childbirth vs women who did not have a childbirth.Results: Of 396 397 women whose data were analyzed, 17 294 (4.4%) had a record of at least 1 first-trimester abortion and no children, 72 052 (18.2%) had at least 1 childbirth and no abortions, 13 540 (3.4%) had at least 1 abortion and 1 childbirth, and 293 511 (74.1%) had neither an abortion nor a childbirth. A total of 59 465 (15.0%) had a record of first antidepressant use. In the basic and fully adjusted models, relative to women who had not had an abortion, women who had a first abortion had a higher risk of first-time antidepressant use. However, the fully adjusted IRRs that compared women who had an abortion with women who did not have an abortion were not statistically different in the year before the abortion (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54) and the year after the abortion (IRR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.45-1.62) (P = .10) and decreased as time from the abortion increased (1-5 years: IRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.29; >5 years: IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18). The fully adjusted IRRs that compared women who gave birth with women who did not give birth were lower in the year before childbirth (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.43-0.50) compared with the year after childbirth (IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) (P < .001) and increased as time from the childbirth increased (1-5 years: IRR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.47-1.56; >5 years: IRR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.91-2.09). Across all women in the sample, the strongest risk factors associated with antidepressant use in the fully adjusted model were having a previous psychiatric contact (IRR, 3.70; 95% CI, 3.62-3.78), having previously obtained an antianxiety medication (IRR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.99-3.10), and having previously obtained antipsychotic medication (IRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.81-1.96).Conclusions and Relevance: Women who have abortions are more likely to use antidepressants compared with women who do not have abortions. However, additional aforementioned findings from this study support the conclusion that increased use of antidepressants is not attributable to having had an abortion but to differences in risk factors for depression. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion harms women's mental health may be misinformed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the risks of attempted and completed suicide in women who experienced a stillbirth, miscarriage, or termination of pregnancy within 1 year postnatally and compare this risk with that in women who experienced a live birth.Design: A nested case-control study.Setting: Linking three nationwide population-based data sets in Taiwan: the National Health Insurance Research Database, the National Birth Registry and the National Death Registry.Sample: In all, 485 and 350 cases of attempted and completed suicide, respectively, were identified during 2001-11; for each case, ten controls were randomly selected and matched to the cases according to the age and year of delivery.Methods: Conditional logistic regression.Main Outcome Measures: Attempted and completed suicidal statuses were determined.Results: The rates of attempted suicide increased in the women who experienced fetal loss. The risk of completed suicide was higher in women who experienced a stillbirth [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.2; 95% CI 1.77-15.32], miscarriage (aOR 3.81; 95% CI 2.81-5.15), or termination of pregnancy (aOR 3.12; 95% CI 1.77-5.5) than in those who had a live birth. Furthermore, the risk of attempted suicide was significantly higher in women who experienced a miscarriage (aOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.66-2.65) or termination of pregnancy (aOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.63-3.82). In addition to marital and educational statuses, psychological illness increased the risk of suicidal behaviour.Conclusions: The risk of suicide might increase in women who experience fetal loss within 1 year postnatally. Healthcare professionals and family members should enhance their sensitivity to care for possible mental distress, particularly for women who have experienced a stillbirth.Tweetable Abstract: Suicide risk increased in women who had a stillbirth, miscarriage, or termination of pregnancy within 1 year postnatally.

AB  - Abstract Rationale More thoroughly understanding the association between elevated depressive symptoms and effectiveness level of contraceptive method selected at a reproductive health visit could help women prevent unintended pregnancy. Objective This study examined how the association between both current and past depressive symptoms and effectiveness level of contraceptive method selected at a clinic visit varies by type of reproductive health visit. Methods Current and past depressive symptoms and contraceptive method selected were assessed among 1215 women aged 18–25 years seeking general reproductive health or abortion services at 40 community clinics throughout the United States. Using standard categories of effectiveness based on pregnancy rates during typical use, women's contraceptive method selected was coded as a low (e.g., no method, withdrawal, condoms), moderately (pill, patch, ring, or shot), or highly effective method (IUD, sterilization, implant). Depression status was divided into four categories: 1) no elevated depressive symptoms ever, 2) current elevated depressive symptoms only, 3) past elevated depressive symptoms only, and 4) past and current elevated depressive symptoms. Visit type, general reproductive health versus abortion care, was a moderator. The interaction effect between depressive symptoms and visit type on contraceptive method effectiveness level chosen was estimated with multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results In general reproductive health visits, having both elevated current and past depressive symptoms increased women's likelihood of choosing low versus moderately effective methods (RRR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.31 to 13.71, p <.0005). In contrast, among abortion patients, only current elevated depressive symptoms were associated with choosing high versus moderate effectiveness methods (RRR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.86, p =.029). Conclusion Results suggest that considering both women's current and past elevated depressive symptoms and the type of reproductive health visit may assist providers in helping women prevent unintended pregnancy. Highlights • Elevated depressive symptoms predicted contraceptive effectiveness method chosen. • Current depressive symptoms predicted choosing highly effective methods. • Current and past depressive symptoms predicted choosing low effective methods.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Postpartum depression is a disorder affecting individuals' social ability accompanied by dangerous complications in the mother, neonate, and the family of the patient. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of postpartum depression with spiritual well-being and some demographic variables among women referring to health care centers, Qom, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 196 eligible women referring to health care centers affiliated to Qom University of Medical Sciences during 2017. Participants were selected through a convenience sampling technique. Spiritual wellbeing and postpartum depression of the participants were measured through Spiritual Health Questionnaire and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. The data analysis was performed using the SPSS software through Pearson correlation coefficient test, one-way ANOVA test, and independent t-test. Results: The mean age of individuals was 28.58±5.97. The postpartum depression score above 12 was among 20 women (10.2%). Postpartum depression had a significant relationship with the mean score of spiritual well-being as well as cognitive/emotional and behavioral dimensions. There was a significantly negative correlation between spiritual well-being and postpartum depression among women (r=-0.52, P<0.001). Moreover, postpartum depression significantly correlated with the type of delivery, abortion history, job status, and educational level of the investigated women. Conclusion: According to the obtained results of the study, the participants had a desirable level of spiritual well-being, and a higher score in spiritual well-being led to a lower postpartum depression score.

AB  - Importance: Evidence indicates that there are potential health, development, and maternal bonding consequences for children born from unwanted pregnancies. Objective: To examine the association of women receiving or being denied a wanted abortion with their children's health and well-being. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 5-year longitudinal observational study with a quasi-experimental design conducted between January 18, 2008, and January 25, 2016, examined women who received abortions just under the gestational age limit of 30 abortion facilities across the United States and women who were denied abortion just beyond the gestational age limit in these facilities. Analyses compared the children of 146 women who were denied an abortion (index children) with children born to 182 women who received an abortion and had a subsequent child within 5 years (subsequent children). Interview-to-interview retention averaged 94.5% (6895 of 7293) across the 11 semi-annual interviews. Exposures: Being born after denial of abortion vs after a new pregnancy subsequent to an abortion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Perinatal outcomes and child health, child development, maternal bonding, socioeconomics, and household structure. Results: This study included 328 women who had children during the study period (mean [SD] age at study recruitment, 23.7 [4.9] years). There were no differences by study group in consent to participate in the study, completion of first interview, or continuation in the study. Among the 328 children in the study (146 index children and 182 subsequent children), there were 163 girls and 165 boys. Perinatal and child health outcomes were not different between subsequent and index children, and there was no clear pattern of delayed child development. However, mixed-effects models adjusting for clustered recruitment and multiple observations per child revealed that poor maternal bonding was more common for index children compared with subsequent children (9% vs 3%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.48-17.85). Index children lived in households with lower incomes relative to the federal poverty level than did subsequent children (101% vs 132% of federal poverty level; adjusted regression coefficient, –0.31; 95% CI, –0.52 to –0.10), and were more likely to live in households without enough money to pay for basic living expenses (72% vs 55%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.16; 95% CI, 2.34-11.40). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that access to abortion enables women to choose to have children at a time when they have more financial and emotional resources to devote to their children. This quasi-experimental study compares outcomes of children born from pregnancies of mothers who sought but were denied abortion with outcomes of children born within the next 5 years to women who had received an abortion. Key Points: Question: How do the health and well-being of children born after denial of abortion compare with those born subsequently to women who received an abortion? Findings: In this quasi-experimental study of 146 children born after denial of abortion and 182 children from subsequent pregnancies in women who received an abortion, higher proportions of children born after denial of abortion experienced poor maternal bonding and lived in subjective poverty. There were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes, child physical health, or child development. Meaning: Denying women desired abortions may be associated with poorer maternal bonding and greater poverty than enabling women to postpone childbearing.

AB  - Objective: We compared rates of induced abortion among women veterans receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare to rates in the general US population, as current policy prohibits VA provision of abortion counseling or services even when pregnancy endangers a veteran's life.Methods: We analyzed data from 2298 women veterans younger than 45 years who completed a telephone-based, cross-sectional survey of randomly sampled English-speaking women from across the United States who had received VA healthcare. We compared lifetime, last-5-year and last-year rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion among participants to age-matched data from the National Survey of Family Growth. As few abortions were reported in the last year, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between abortion in the last 5 years and age, race/ethnicity, income, education, religion, marital status, parity, geography, deployment history, housing instability, and past medical and mental health among VA patients.Results: Women veterans were more likely than matched US women to report ever having an abortion [17.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.1%-19.3% vs. 15.2% of US women]. In the last 5 years, unintended pregnancy and abortion were reported by veterans at rates similar to US women. In multivariable models, VA patients were more likely to report abortion in the last 5 years if their annual income was less than $40,000 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.30-6.70), they had experienced homelessness or housing instability (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.01-3.62), they were single (adj. OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.23-4.91) and/or they had given birth (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.19-4.40).Conclusion: Women veterans face unintended pregnancy and seek abortion as often as the larger US population.Implications: The Veterans Health Care Act, which prohibits provision of abortion services, increases vulnerable veterans' out-of-pocket healthcare costs and limits veterans' reproductive freedom.

AB  - Background: Teenage pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of premature death. However, it is not known whether the outcome of pregnancy, i.e. induced abortion or childbirth, affects this risk. Methods: A Finnish population-based register study involving a cohort of 13 691 nulliparous teenagers who conceived in 1987-89; 6652 of them underwent induced abortion and 7039 delivered. The control group consisted of 41012 coeval women without teenage pregnancy. Follow-up started at the end of pregnancy and lasted until 6th June 2013. Results: Women with teenage pregnancy had a higher risk of overall mortality vs. controls (mortality rate ratio [MRR] 1.6, [95% CI 1.4-1.8]) and were more likely to die prematurely as a result of suicide, alcohol-related causes, circulatory diseases and motor vehicle accidents. A low educational level appeared to explain these excess risks, except for suicide (adj. MRR 1.5, [95% CI 1.1-2.0]). After adjusting for confounders, the childbirth group faced lower risks of suicide (adj. MRR 0.5, [95% CI 0.3-0.9]) and dying from injury and poisoning (adj. MRR 0.6, [95% CI 0.4-0.8]) compared with women who had undergone abortion. Conclusions: A low educational level is associated with the increased risk of premature death among women with a history of teenage pregnancy, except for suicide. Extra efforts should be made to encourage pregnant teenagers to continue education, and to provide psychosocial support to teenagers who undergo induced abortion.

AB  - Background: Despite reports of mental health issues, suicidality has not been closely examined among the migrant population. The association between induced abortion and suicidal ideation is unknown among unmarried female migrant workers of reproductive age in China. This study aims to examine induced abortion and suicidality among the Chinese migrant population.Methods: We recruited 5115 unmarried female migrant workers during 2015 to 2016 from Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, and collected demographic, psychosocial, reproductive and mental health information using structured questionnaires. We used logistic regression models to examine the association between lifetime induced abortion and suicidal ideation during the past year among the subjects.Results: Overall, 8.2% of the subjects had suicidal ideation during the past year, and 15.5% of the subjects experienced induced abortion. Induced abortion was associated with nearly twice the odds of having past-year suicidal ideation (Odds ratio, OR = 1.89; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.46, 2.44) after adjusting for age, education, years in the working place, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, daily internet use, attitude towards premarital pregnancy, multiple induced abortion, self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and anxiety disorders. The association was stronger in those aged > 25 (OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 2.16, 5.28), with > 5 years of stay in the working place (OR = 2.98, 95% CI = 2.02, 4.39), the non-anxiety group (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.74, 3.00), and the non-depression group (OR = 2.94, 95% CI = 2.08, 4.15).Conclusions: Induced abortion was associated with increased odds for suicidal ideation among the unmarried female migrant workers in urban cities in China. More attention should be paid to the mental health of the population.

AB  - Objective To prospectively assess perceptions of abortion stigma after receiving or being denied an abortion over 5 years, the factors associated with perceived abortion stigma, and the effects of perceived abortion stigma on psychological well-being. Methods We recruited people seeking abortion from 30 facilities across the US, and interviewed them by phone one week post-abortion seeking, then semiannually for 5 years. We used adjusted mixed effects regression analyses to examine the abortion stigma trajectories of those who obtained an abortion near a facility's gestational age limit (Near-limits) compared to those denied an abortion because they were just over the limit and carried their pregnancies to term (Turnaway-births). Results Of the 956 people recruited, we removed 28 due to ineligibility or missing data, leaving a final sample of 928. In unadjusted analyses, at one-week post-abortion seeking, over half of those seeking abortion perceived that if others knew they had sought an abortion, they would be looked down upon at least "a little bit" by people close to them (60%) or by people in their community (56%). In longitudinal adjusted analyses, people denied an abortion and who carried their pregnancies to term (Turnaway-birth group) reported significantly lower baseline perceived abortion stigma from people close to them (-0.38; 95% CI, -0.59, -0.16) and from people in their community (0.30; 95% CI, -0.52, -0.08), than Near-limits, differences that remained statistically significant for 1.5 years. Overall perceived abortion stigma declined significantly (p < .001) for both study groups. High perceived abortion stigma at baseline was associated with higher odds of experiencing psychological distress years later (adjusted Odds Ratio, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.39, 11.37). Conclusions Most people considering abortion perceive some abortion stigma, which is associated with psychological distress years later.Copyright © 2020 Biggs et al.

AB  - Objective:To investigate the suicidal ideation among unmarried female migrant workers in Shanghai and Guangzhou and explore the association between suicidal ideation and some psychosocial problems, reproductive health factors. Method(s):A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3 553 unmarried female migrant workers in two factories in Shanghai and two in Guangzhou by convenient sampling. Logistic regression was used to analyze the related factors of suicide ideation including psychosocial problems and reproductive health factors. Result(s):Overall, 287(8.1%) of the respondents had suicidal ideation during the past year. Univariate Logistic regression showed that alcohol, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, loneliness, poor social support (emotional support and economic support), favorable attitude toward premarital pregnancy, favorable attitude toward multiple induced abortion, experience of unplanned pregnancy and experience of induced abortion were related to suicidal ideation after demographic factors being corrected. Multivariate Logistic regression showed that alcohol (OR=1.42, 95% CI 1.04-1.93), low self-esteem (OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.11), loneliness (OR=3.30, 95% CI 2.42-4.51), poor emotional support (OR=2.68, 95% CI 2.00-3.61) and poor economic support (OR=3.79, 95% CI 2.86-5.04) were the critical factors. Conclusion(s):The factors such as risk behavior, mental health, lack of social support were associated with increased odds for suicidal ideation among the unmarried female migrant workers. The prevention and intervention mechanism should be constructed, and the social support should be enhanced to effectively prevent the occurrence of suicidal ideation.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

TI  - Affective and Substance Abuse Disorders Following Abortion by Pregnancy Intention in the United States: A Longitudinal Cohort Study
AU  - Sullins D.P.
PY  - 2019
PD  - 
AB  - Background and Objectives: Psychological outcomes following termination of wanted pregnancies have not previously been studied. Does excluding such abortions affect estimates of psychological distress following abortion? To address this question this study examines long-term psychological outcomes by pregnancy intention (wanted or unwanted) following induced abortion relative to childbirth in the United States. Material(s) and Method(s): Panel data on a nationally-representative cohort of 3935 ever-pregnant women assessed at mean age of 15, 22, and 28 years were examined from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Relative risk (RR) and incident rate ratios (IRR) for time-dynamic mental health outcomes, conditioned by pregnancy intention and abortion exposure, were estimated from population-averaged longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models, with extensive adjustment for sociodemographic differences, pregnancy and mental health history, and other confounding factors. Outcomes were assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 4, American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria or another validated index for suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety (affective problems); drug abuse, opioid abuse, alcohol abuse, and cannabis abuse (substance abuse problems); and summary total disorders. Result(s): Women who terminated one or more wanted pregnancies experienced a 43% higher risk of affective problems (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.3-2.2) relative to childbirth, compared to women terminating only unwanted pregnancies (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.0-1.4). Risks of depression (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.3-3.8) and suicidality (RR 3.44 95% CI 1.5-7.7) were especially elevated with wanted pregnancy abortion. Relative risk of substance abuse disorders with any abortion was high, at about 2.0, but unaffected by pregnancy intention. Excluding wanted pregnancies artifactually reduced estimates of affective disorders by 72% from unity, substance abuse disorders by 11% from unity, and total disorders by 21% from unity. Conclusion(s): Excluding wanted pregnancies moderately understates overall risk and strongly understates affective risk of mental health difficulties for women following abortion. Compared to corresponding births, abortions of wanted pregnancies are associated with a greater risk of negative psychological affect, particularly depression and suicide ideation, but not greater risk of substance abuse, than are abortions of unwanted pregnancies. Clinical, research, and policy implications are discussed briefly.

AB  - Background: Research demonstrates worse short-term morbidity and mortality associated with childbirth than with abortion, but little research has examined long-term physical health in women with unwanted pregnancies after abortion versus childbirth. Objective(s): To examine the physical health of women who seek and receive or are denied abortion. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Setting(s): 30 U.S. abortion facilities from 2008 to 2010. Participant(s): Of 1132 women seeking abortion who consented to participate, 874 were included in this analysis (328 who had first-trimester abortion, 383 who had second-trimester abortion, and 163 who gave birth). Measurements: Self-reported overall health; chronic abdominal, pelvic, back, and joint pain; chronic headaches or migraines; obesity; asthma; gestational and nongestational hypertension and diabetes; and hyperlipidemia were assessed semiannually for 5 years. Mortality was assessed by using verbal autopsy and public records. Result(s): No significant differences were observed in self-rated health or chronic pain after first-trimester versus secondtrimester abortion. At 5 years, 27% (95% CI, 21% to 34%) of women who gave birth reported fair or poor health compared with 20% (CI, 16% to 24%) of women who had first-trimester abortion and 21% (CI, 18% to 25%) who had second-trimester abortion. Women who gave birth also reported more chronic headaches or migraines and joint pain, but experienced similar levels of other types of chronic pain and obesity. Gestational hypertension was reported by 9.4% of participants who gave birth. Eight of 1132 participants died during follow-up, 2 in the postpartum period. Maternal mortality did not differ statistically by group. Limitation(s): Self-reported outcome measures, uncertain generalizability, and 41% loss to follow-up at 5 years. Conclusion(s): Although some argue that abortion is detrimental to women's health, these study data indicate that physical health is no worse in women who sought and underwent abortion than in women who were denied abortion. Indeed, differences emerged suggesting worse health among those who gave birth.Copyright © 2019 American College of Physicians.

AB  - Purpose We described the medication use during pregnancy in the French population using the French Pregnancy Cohort (FPC). Methods The FPC was built with the sampling of all pregnant women included in the French Echantillon generaliste des beneficiaires (EGB), which is a 1/97th representative sample of the population covered by the French health insurance. The EGB includes anonymized information on the socio-demographic and medical characteristics of beneficiaries, and the health care services they have received such as diagnoses and procedure codes as well as data on filled reimbursed medication; EGB also includes data on hospital stays in all public and private French health facilities. Each filled prescription record contains information on drug brand and generic names, date of prescription and date of dispensing, quantity dispensed, mode of administration, duration of prescription, dosage, and prescribing physician specialty. FPC includes data on all pregnancies of women in the EGB (2010-2013). Date of entry in the FPC is the first day of pregnancy regardless of pregnancy outcome (spontaneous abortions or planned abortions (with or without medical reasons), deliveries), and data on women are collected retrospectively for a period of one year before pregnancy, and prospectively during pregnancy, and up to one year after delivery. The prevalence of prescribed medications before, during and after pregnancy was compared; comparison was also done between trimesters. Pregnancy outcomes are described and include spontaneous and planned abortions, livebirths, and stillbirths. Results FPC includes data on 36,065 pregnancies. Among them, 27,253 (75.6%) resulted in a delivery including 201 stillbirths (0.7%). The total number of spontaneous abortions was 6,718 (18.6%), and planned abortions 2,094 (5.8%). The prevalence of filled medication use was 91.1%, 89.9%, and 95.6% before, during and after pregnancy, respectively. Although there was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of use once the pregnancy was diagnosed (first trimester exposure, 76.4% vs. exposure in the year prior to pregnancy, 91.1% (p < .01)), post-pregnancy medication use was above the pre-pregnancy level (95.6%). Maternal depression was the most prevalent comorbidity during pregnancy (20%), and post-partum depression was higher in those who delivered a stillborn infant (38.8%) as well as in those with a spontaneous (19.5%) or planned abortion (22.4%) compared to those with a liveborn (12.0%). Conclusion FPC is an excellent tool for the study of the risk and benefit of drug use during the perinatal period. FPC has the advantage of including a representative sample of French pregnant women, and study medications only available in France in addition to others available worldwide.Copyright © 2019 Berard et al.

AB  - Background: Suicidal ideation due to abortion has been used to justify restrictive US abortion policies. Much research examining abortion and mental health has relied on self-report, has had low participation rates, and did not consider confounding factors. In the present study, we used data that do not rely on self-report and are not affected by low participation rates to examine the association between abortion and non-fatal suicide attempts, adjusting for confounding factors. Method(s): In this longitudinal cohort study of Danish population registries, we linked data on a cohort of women born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 30, 1998, who did not die or emigrate from Denmark before their 18th birthday or before study entry. Follow-up started on the woman's 18th birthday or Jan 1, 2000, whichever came last. Follow-up ended at the date of first suicide attempt, date of emigration from Denmark, date of death, or Dec 31, 2016, whichever came first. Women were between the ages of 18 and 36 years during the study period. We used a survival analysis to examine the risk of first suicide attempts or self-harm associated with a first abortion compared with no abortion, in the complete study cohort. To examine incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with abortion, we used Poisson regression with the logarithm of woman-years at risk as an offset. We also examined whether the risk of suicide attempts changed before and after the abortion, adjusting for age, calendar year, socioeconomic status, and history of childbirth, mental health, parental mental health, and physical health. Finding(s): Data on 523 280 women were included in this study. Of these, 48 990 (9.4%) women had a record of at least one first-trimester abortion, and 10 216 (2.0%) had a suicide attempt during the study period. Among 48 990 women who had an abortion, 1402 (2.9%) had a first suicide attempt after the first abortion. In our fully-adjusted model which adjusted for all covariates, the risk of first-time non-fatal suicide attempts was similar in the year before an abortion (IRR 2.46 [95% CI 2.22-2.72]) and the year after an abortion (IRR 2.54 [2.29-2.81], p=0.509) compared with women who had not had an abortion, and decreased with increasing time since the abortion (1-5 years IRR 1.90 [1.75-2.06]; >=5 years IRR 1.73 [1.53-1.96]). Interpretation(s): We found that women who had abortions had a higher risk of non-fatal suicide attempts compared with women who did not have an abortion. However, because the increased risk was the same both the year before and after the abortion, it is not attributable to the abortion. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion increases women's risk of suicide attempts are misinformed.

AB  - Aim: The goal of this retrospective cohort study was to analyze the relationship between induced abortion and the incidence of depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and somatoform disorder in Germany. Method(s): Women who had undergone induced abortions for the first time in 281 gynecological practices in Germany between January 2007 and December 2016 were included (index date). Women with live births were matched (1:1) to those with induced abortion by age, index year, and physician. The main outcome of the study was the incidence of depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and somatoform disorder as a function of induced abortion. Survival analyses and Cox regression models were used to investigate the association between induced abortion and psychiatric disorders. Result(s): This study included 17581 women who had had an induced abortion and 17581 women who had had a live birth. Within 10 years of the index date, 6.7% of the participants with induced abortions and 5.4% of those with live births were diagnosed with depression (log-rank p-value = 0.003). The respective figures were 3.4% and 2.7% for anxiety disorder (log-rank p-value = 0.255), 6.2% and 5.6% for adjustment disorder (log-rank p-value = 0.116), and 19.3% and 13.3% for somatoform disorder (log-rank p-value<0.001). Induced abortion was significantly associated with depression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.34), adjustment disorder (HR = 1.45) and somatoform disorder (HR = 1.56), but not with anxiety disorder (HR = 1.17). Conclusion(s): There was a positive association between induced abortion and several psychiatric disorders in Germany. Further analyses are recommended to assess how induced abortion can have such a negative impact on mental health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: The association between abortion and postmenopausal mental health has not been clearly established in Asian women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of abortion experiences on suicidal ideation and mental health in Korean postmenopausal women. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 5133 postmenopausal women registered in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2012. Difference in suicidal ideation according to type and number of abortions was analyzed. We used survey multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the effect of abortion experiences on the risk for suicidal ideation expressed as adjusted odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Result(s): The risk of suicidal ideation was significantly higher in women who experienced more than three abortions (27.9%). While the incidence of suicidal ideation was not significantly affected by the number of spontaneous abortions (p = 0.718), suicidal ideation was significantly more frequent in women who had undergone >= three abortions (p = 0.003). After adjusting for demographic confounding factors, women who underwent >= three induced abortions had higher risk for suicidal ideation (OR: 1.510; 95% CI: 1.189-1.919; p = 0.031). This risk remained elevated even after controlling for depression (OR: 1.391; 95% CI: 1.1086-1.871, p = 0.002). Moreover, the risk of experiencing a depressive mood in daily life was also increased with increasing number of induced abortions even after controlling for depression (OR: 1.657; 95% CI: 1.274-2.156, p = 0.002). Conclusion(s): Undergoing three or more induced abortions during reproductive age was associated with postmenopausal suicidal ideation, stress, and depression. However, such association was not noted in those with spontaneous abortion, even in women with more miscarriages. Thus, clinicians should evaluate depression and suicidal ideation in women with multiple induced abortions.Copyright © 2018

AB  - Objective: To investigate the contributory factors of postpartum depression among women in Punjab. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted in rural areas of Faisalabad District. Four hundred postpartum mothers' age 15-44 years having babies under one year were selected through multistage sampling technique and data were collected through well designed interview schedule. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to check the level of postpartum depression. Data were analyzed through univariate and bivariate analyses by using SPSS. Result(s): Out of 400 women, 163(41%) had postpartum depression. Obstetric factors, including the number of abortions, pregnancy complications (anemia, stomachaches, vomiting, high/low blood pressure, viginal bleeding) and delivery complications (premature birth, difficult labor, postpartum hemorrhage) increased the risk of developing postpartum depression. Violence (verbal/physical), stressful life events and low level of social support were also identified as the strong predictors in increasing the prevalence of postpartum depression. Conclusion(s): Most of the mothers had major symptoms of depression in their postpartum period. It is recommended that there is a massive need for counseling and proper medication whenever a mother feel fatigue, sadness, anxiety or stress in the antenatal and postpartum period.Copyright © 2019, Pakistan Medical Association.

AB  - Introduction: Studies of childbearing adolescents document a "protective" effect of pregnancy on trajectories of alcohol and other substance use, although it is unclear how patterns differ when pregnancies result in miscarriage or abortion. Previous studies have relied on between-person designs with limited ability to account for pre-existing group differences. The present study investigated the association between childbirth, miscarriage, and abortion on within-individual changes in adolescent alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use from pre-conception to post-pregnancy. To examine directionality of effects, we additionally tested the reverse path: whether changes in substance use precede pregnancy outcomes. Method(s): Participants included 2,184 girls (52% Black) oversampled from low-income neighborhoods. Alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and pregnancy outcomes were self-reported annually fromage 11-20. Fixed-effects models examined substance use change during the year of each pregnancy outcome relative to pre-childbirth/miscarriage/abortion levels and tested whether changes were sustained in subsequent years. Secondary analyses tested substance use predicting likelihood of pregnancy outcomes. By design, fixed-effects models controlled for all potential time-stable confounds (Allison, 2009); we included age, depression, and peer substance use as time-varying covariates. Result(s): Significant within-person reductions in alcohol (IRR = 0.75, p < 0.01), marijuana (IRR = 0.71, p < 0.01), and cigarette use (IRR = 0.83, p < 0.01) occurred during the year of first births relative to pre-pregnancy levels, and reductions were maintained after birth. No changes emerged during year of miscarriage, although alcohol (IRR = 0.69, p < 0.01) and cigarette use (IRR = 0.85, p = 0.02) decreased after miscarriage. Abortion was not associated with changes in alcohol relative to pre-pregnancy levels (p's>0.05); however, marijuana (IRR = 1.22, p = 0.04) and cigarette use (IRR = 1.34, p = 0.01) significantly increased during year of abortion, with cigarette increasesmaintained after year of abortion. No evidence supported reverse causation (p's >0.05). Conclusion(s): Findings highlight important differences in substance use patterns based on pregnancy outcome. Results are consistent with the protective effects of childbirth on alcohol and other substance use, whereas alcohol use during the year of miscarriage and abortion did not differ from pre-pregnancy levels. The year of abortion may be a critical period of increased cigarette and marijuana use, although research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Substance use screening and intervention among pregnant teens is essential, given continuing alcohol,marijuana, and cigarette use after certain pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - In a previous study (Van Ditzhuijzen et al., 2017) we investigated the incidence and recurrence of mental disorders 2.5 to 3 years post-abortion. The aim of the current study was to extend these findings with longer term follow up data, up until 5-6 years post-abortion. We compared data of women who had had an abortion of the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS) to women who did not have an abortion from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2) (Ntotal = 2227). We used 1-to-1 matching on background confounding variables and measured post-abortion incidence and recurrence of common DSM-IV mental disorders (mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0. After matching on confounding variables, abortion did not increase the likelihood that women had incident or recurrent mental disorders in the 5-6 years post-abortion (any incident mental disorder: OR = 3.66, p =.16; any recurrent mental disorder: OR = 0.22, p =.47). We found no evidence that experiencing an abortion increases the risk on new or recurrent mental disorders on the longer term.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND Examination of possible risk factors (mental disorders, obstetric and psychosocial conditions), in adolescents hospitalized in Lombardy for a first spontaneous abortion, which were identified during pregnancy, at outcome or in the obstetric and psychiatric history and may contribute to the onset of subsequent mental disorders. METHODS The study examines data contained in the hospital discharge records (SDO) of adolescents hospitalized for first spontaneous abortion (n. 4597), comparing them with those detected in women with induced abortion (n. 19991) or normal delivery (n. 22342). Diagnosis of mental disorders have been isolated using ICD 9CM codes. The measures used were: number of evaluated patients per ten thousand (ptt), Crude age-specific index, Odds Ratio with 95% CI, Fischer's test. RESULTS At hospital discharge a lower frequency of mental disorders emerged in the spontaneous abortion group (2.18 ptt) compared to the normal delivery (2.24) or the induced abortion group (4.05), with a large prevalence of women without any diagnosis of mental disorders. in the three groups, at pregnancy outcome, a higher occurrence of mental disorders was detected compared to the occurrence in pregnancy or psychiatric history. in women of 15-19 years a higher frequency of mental disorders was detected compared to ranges 20-24 and 10-14 as well as a higher probability of an outcome consisting in spontaneous or induced abortion. the sDO have provided more information on obstetric history than on mental disorders or family and psychosocial context as supplied by women. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest the need for a transverse and multifactorial evaluation of the risks present in the different stages of pregnancy as well as the support provided to the adolescents in evolutionary tasks such as the procreative competence, which is deemed significant by the woman and her family.Copyright © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - Background: Recent research efforts sought to characterize the risk of unplanned pregnancy in teenage girls with selected mental disorders, including substance use disorders and mania. The dearth of available data underscores the need to examine more fully risk factors for teenage pregnancy related to mental disorders. To the best of our knowledge, no prior population-based study has assessed teenage pregnancy rates by types of mental disorders. Objective(s): This study aimed to estimate crude pregnancy rates among teenage girls with mental illness stratified by 15 subtypes of mental disorders and to identify age-adjusted relationships between disorder types and teen pregnancy rates. Method(s): We established a retrospective cohort of females aged 13-19 years anytime between 2005 and 2014, using the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database. Cohort patients had continuous enrollment for two consecutive calendar years and at least two claims for outpatient or inpatient encounters with mental disorder diagnosis during this time. Patients were classified as experiencing pregnancy if they had at least two claims that indicated pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes including abortions, stillbirth, and live birth. In each two-year interval, the pregnancy rate was calculated as the number of patients whose conception date was in the second of the two years, divided by the total number of patients included in the interval. For each patient, only one pregnancy episodes in a given calendar year was considered. Result(s): Pregnancy rates were 18.4 vs 12.8 per 1000 teens with and without mental disorders, respectively. The 5 mental disorders with the highest teen pregnancy rates were 1) substance-related disorders (77.6/1,000), alcohol-related disorders (64.7/1,000), suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury (44.1/1000), bipolar disorders (39.7/1,000), and personality disorders (38/1,000). After adjusting for age in a multiple logistic regression, substance-related disorders (OR: 3.67 [95% CI: 2.90-4.63]), alcohol-related disorders (3.08 [2.63-3.61]), suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury (2.70 [2.20-3.32]) and bipolar disorders (2.23 [1.93-2.59]) were strongly associated with teen pregnancy compared with those who did not have any mental disorders. Conclusion(s): Using 10 years of commercial claims data, we found certain mental disorders were strongly associated with an increased pregnancy rate among teenage girls aged 13-19 years.

AB  - Background: Opioids are used in the treatment of chronic and acute pain. A dramatic increase in the number of opioid prescriptions has been observed over the last 20 years, including among pregnant women. Objective(s): To determine the prevalence, indications, and predictors of opioid use during pregnancy in a large population-based cohort of pregnant women. Method(s): This study was performed within the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, which includes data on all pregnancies covered by the Quebec Provincial drug insurance plan between 1998 and 2015. Prescriptions filled for opioid agents were obtained using pharmacy claims. Opioids were first defined as a class and then by individual agent (i.e., codeine, hydromorphone, meperidine, morphine, oxycodone, morphine, pentazocine, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine). Pattern variations of filled opioid agent use are presented by calendar year and based on pregnancy outcome (live birth, planned abortion, or spontaneous abortion). Opioid user characteristics were compared to nonusers to identify predictors. Result(s): Among the 442,079 eligible pregnancies, 23,257 (52.6 per 1,000) pregnancies were exposed to opioid agents during pregnancy; this prevalence increased from 42.7 in 1998 to 52.6 in 2015 per 1,000 pregnancies (p< 0.001). Codeine and hydromorphone were the most commonly prescribed opioid agents. The prevalence of codeine use during pregnancy began to decrease in 2006 while the prevalence of hydromorphone and morphine increased. The median number of filled prescriptions for opioid agents was one (first quartile=one; third quartile=two). The prevalence of opioid use during pregnancy was higher among pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortion than in pregnancies ending in live birth (71.7 versus 54.9 per 1,000 pregnancies). Users of opioids during pregnancy were more likely to live in rural area and be welfare recipient than nonusers. Users had more comorbidities related to opioid (headaches and migraine, chronic pain, genitourinary pathologic evidence, and orthopedic pathologic evidence). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of opioid use during pregnancy is increasing. Physicians need to carefully evaluate the risks and benefits when prescribing opioid agents during the sensitive period of pregnancy.

AB  - Research in the field of mental health consequences of abortion is characterized by methodological limitations. We used exact matching on carefully selected confounders in a prospective cohort study of 325 women who had an abortion of an unwanted pregnancy and compared them 1-to-1 to controls who did not have this experience. Outcome measures were incidence and recurrence of common DSM-IV mental disorders (mood, anxiety, substance use disorders, and the aggregate measure 'any mental disorder') as measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0, in the 2.5-3 years after the abortion. Although non-matched data suggested otherwise, women in the abortion group did not show significantly higher odds for incidence of 'any mental disorder', or mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, compared to matched controls who were similar in background variables but did not have an this experience. Having an abortion did not increase the odds for recurrence of the three disorder categories, but for any mental disorder the higher odds in the abortion group remained significant after matching. It is unlikely that termination of an unwanted pregnancy increases the risk on incidence of common mental disorders in women without a psychiatric history. However, it might increase the risk of recurrence among women with a history of mental disorders.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: We examined first-time antidepressant use around a first abortion and compared this with antidepressant use around a first childbirth. Method(s): Using a cohort of 396,397 women from the Danish Population Registries, born between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1994, we followed women from their 18th birthday or January 1, 2000, whichever came last, until the date they obtained an antidepressant for the first time, date of immigration from Denmark, date of death or December 31, 2015, whichever came last. Using survival analyses, we examined the risk [incidence rate ratios (IRRs)] of first-time antidepressant use associated with having an abortion and the risk associated with having a birth in the same model, adjusting for confounders. Result(s): In adjusted analyses, the risk of first-time antidepressant use was the same in the year before (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54) and after an abortion (vs. no abortion) (IRR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.45-1.62) but decreased after 1 year (1-5 years afterward, IRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.29; 5+ years afterward, IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18). In contrast, even though childbirth protected women from using antidepressants for the first time in the year before birth (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.43-0.50), it was less protective during the year after birth (IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98). Furthermore, childbirth was no longer protective after 1 year (1-5 years afterward, IRR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.47-1.56; 5+ years afterward, IRR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.91-2.09). Conclusion(s): These results show that abortion does not increase the risk of antidepressant use.

AB  - Here's what the study revealed: Women who were denied an abortion were associated with mental health difficulties, specifically anxiety and depression. Women who were able to access the abortion they wanted had more positive outcomes in terms of mental health (so much for the accusation that women regret their abortions). Over the course of 5 years, however, the two groups actually reached the same place, in that the mental health of women who weren't able to get an abortion did improve. The Turnaway Study also noted that women's self esteem levels were lowest just before having an abortion, but were back up after the procedure. To recap: in the short term or the long term, getting an abortion didn't negatively impact the mental health of the women who had one. But getting turned away for one did, at least in the short term.

AB  - Background and Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depression in women with preterm delivery in Jahrom city in 2017. Method: The research population of women with preterm labor, who had been at least 6 weeks to 1 year since their delivery, were deprived of the previous history of depression and referred to psychiatrists and drug users, and were covered by a health center in Jahrom city. A randomized-stratified random sample of 115 eligible people entered the study. The instrument used was demographic and depression questionnaires. Results: The results of the study showed that there is a significant relationship between the number of children and depression (p = 0.001). The results showed that mothers with one child had higher levels of depression than mothers with more children. Also, there is a significant relationship between the number of pregnancies, abortion history, type of delivery, child's gender, unintended pregnancy, child's unwanted gender from the father's and the mother's point of view and type of child feeding and depression. Mothers with first pregnancy had higher depression than other mothers. Mothers without a history of abortion had higher rates of depression than those with abortion history. Conclusion: The results of this study indicated a high prevalence of mild depression in women with preterm labor in Jahrom city in 2018.

AB  - The scope of this study is to describe the prevalence and the factors associated with common mental disorders in women aged 18 to 49, residents in the rural zone of the municipality of Rio Grande-RS. A cross-sectional study was carried out with data collection conducted in 2017. A systematic sampling process of the residences of the rural area of the municipality was utilized. The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ12) was used to track common mental disorders. Crude and adjusted Poisson regression was used to estimate the prevalence ratios (PR) and respective 95% confidence intervals. The overall prevalence of Common Mental Disorders was 36.4%, being more common among women with lower levels of education, who had had an abortion and were smokers. In quantifying the occurrence and factors associated with common mental disorders in a population of women in a rural area, this study provides an original scientific contribution on the burden of this important outcome in a population that has not been studied in epidemiological surveys. The results can contribute to the health services by identifying the women most susceptible to this outcome, thus, improving the adequacy of the services offered to the health needs of rural residents.

AB  - Objectives: This study was aimed to measure the prevalence and associated risk factors of antenatal depression (AD) among women attending antenatal clinics at primary care centers in the Ministry of Health in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 357 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at primary care centers, Ministry of Health, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia between April 1, 2018 and July 1, 2019. A self-administered questionnaire was used for collection of information including questions relevant to sociodemographic variables and a screening tool Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess the probable depression. Results: The prevalence of AD among pregnant women in Al-Ahsa is 31.9%. We found a significant association (P<0.005) between AD and factors such as difficulty in sleeping, having a smoker husband, having one previous pregnancy, and having postabortion psychological complications. Conclusion: It was observed that depression prevails among pregnant ladies in Al-Ahsa city. Hence, in the present study, we tried to rule out the factors that led to depression in pregnant ladies during our antenatal care. In addition, we found that there is a need to train the physicians for asking questions (only two simple PHQ-2 questions) for the screening of depression during antenatal care visit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is an umbrella, which encompasses several mood disorders that follow childbirth within 6 weeks. Screening for postpartum depression would improve the ability to recognize these disorders and enhance care that ensures improved clinical outcomes. Early identification of postpartum depression is important in order to plan for implementation strategies that allow for timely treatment and support of women with postpartum depression., OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of postpartum depression among women who gave birth in the last six weeks in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia, 2018., METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 526 women who gave birth in the last 6 weeks from July 1 to 30, 2018 in Gondar town. Cluster sampling technique was used. Data were collected by semi-structured and pretested questionnaire and entered into epi-Info version 7.0 and then analyzed by SPSS version 20.0. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model were fitted. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval has been computed and variables with p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant., RESULTS: The prevalence of postpartum depression among 526 postnatal women was 25% (95% CI: 21, 28). Abortion history (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.97), birth weight <2.5 kg (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.78, 5.48), gestational age below 36 weeks (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.22, 3.88) unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.31), relatives' mental illness (AOR = 1.20: 1.09-3.05), had no antenatal visit (AOR = 4.05, 95% CI: 1.81, 9.05), had no postnatal visit (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.00) were factors significantly associated with postpartum depression. Conclusion and Recommendations. The prevalence of PPD was found to be higher. Variables like abortion history, low birth weight, gestational age below 36 weeks, unplanned pregnancy, relatives' mental illness, had no antenatal visit, and had no postnatal visit were predisposing factors to postpartum depression. Preventive measures to avoid low birth weight and pregnancy complications are also identified as proactive ways to reduce postpartum depression. Early identification and treatment of depression during ANC and postpartum care can mitigate the impact of PPD on the mother-baby dyad. Emphasis must be given women to have ANC and PNC follow up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abortion and loss of pregnancy in the first trimester may affect maternal mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to determine the severity of post-abortion stress in spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, and Forensic Medical Center (FMC) referral abortions immediately after abortion and after 1 month of follow-up in Shiraz, Iran, in 2018., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 104 mothers selected through convenience sampling method in 2018. The data collection tools included a demographic characteristics questionnaire and the Mississippi Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (M-PTSD) Scale that were filled out by mothers immediately and 1 month after the abortion. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc LSD test in SPSS software. Moreover, p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant., RESULTS: The mean (SD) of post-traumatic stress scores was 83.87 (18.35) and 77.40 (9.88) in spontaneous abortion, 82.28 (13.27) and 75.71 (14.73) in FMC permitted abortions, and 86.66 (10.10) and 74.98 (12.99) in induced abortions immediately and 1 month after abortion, respectively. Stress was reduced in the three groups of mothers, after one month of severe value. The score for frequency of stress was 3.10% in FMC-permitted abortions and 5.10% in induced abortions; moreover, no stress was observed in the spontaneous abortion cases., CONCLUSIONS: Stress was gradually reduced over time. The level of PTSD was lower after 1 month in women who had experienced spontaneous abortion. Given that 1 month after abortion, women are still often moderately stressed, follow-up care, and appropriate counseling for these women are necessary.

AB  - Reports an error in 'The association between first abortion and first-time non-fatal suicide attempt: A longitudinal cohort study of danish population registries' by Julia R Steinberg, Thomas M Laursen, Nancy E Adler, Christiane Gasse, Esben Agerbo and Trine Munk-Olsen (The Lancet Psychiatry, Advanced Online Publication, Nov 13, 2019, np). In the original article, the ATC code N03AE01 was missing a number. This correction has been made to the online version as of Jan 9, 2020. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-71813-001[/rid]). BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation due to abortion has been used to justify restrictive US abortion policies. Much research examining abortion and mental health has relied on self-report, has had low participation rates, and did not consider confounding factors. In the present study, we used data that do not rely on self-report and are not affected by low participation rates to examine the association between abortion and non-fatal suicide attempts, adjusting for confounding factors. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study of Danish population registries, we linked data on a cohort of women born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 30, 1998, who did not die or emigrate from Denmark before their 18th birthday or before study entry. Follow-up started on the woman's 18th birthday or Jan 1, 2000, whichever came last. Follow-up ended at the date of first suicide attempt, date of emigration from Denmark, date of death, or Dec 31, 2016, whichever came first. Women were between the ages of 18 and 36 years during the study period. We used a survival analysis to examine the risk of first suicide attempts or self-harm associated with a first abortion compared with no abortion, in the complete study cohort. To examine incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with abortion, we used Poisson regression with the logarithm of woman-years at risk as an offset. We also examined whether the risk of suicide attempts changed before and after the abortion, adjusting for age, calendar year, socioeconomic status, and history of childbirth, mental health, parental mental health, and physical health. FINDINGS: Data on 523 280 women were included in this study. Of these, 48 990 (9·4%) women had a record of at least one first-trimester abortion, and 10 216 (2·0%) had a suicide attempt during the study period. Among 48 990 women who had an abortion, 1402 (2·9%) had a first suicide attempt after the first abortion. In our fully-adjusted model which adjusted for all covariates, the risk of first-time non-fatal suicide attempts was similar in the year before an abortion (IRR 2·46 [95% CI 2·22–2·72]) and the year after an abortion (IRR 2·54 [2·29–2·81], p=0·509) compared with women who had not had an abortion, and decreased with increasing time since the abortion (1–5 years IRR 1·90 [1·75–2·06]; ≥5 years IRR 1·73 [1·53–1·96]). INTERPRETATION: We found that women who had abortions had a higher risk of non-fatal suicide attempts compared with women who did not have an abortion. However, because the increased risk was the same both the year before and after the abortion, it is not attributable to the abortion. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion increases women's risk of suicide attempts are misinformed.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Current and past depressive symptoms and contraceptive effectiveness level method selected among women seeking reproductive health services' by Julia R. Steinberg, Nancy E. Adler, Kirsten M. Thompson, Carolyn Westhoff and Cynthia C. Harper (Social Science & Medicine, 2018[Oct], Vol 214, 20-25). In the original article, the title words were mixed up. The correct title is: Current and past depressive symptoms and effectiveness level of contraceptive method selected among women seeking reproductive health services. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2018-48529-004[/rid]). Rationale: More thoroughly understanding the association between elevated depressive symptoms and effectiveness level of contraceptive method selected at a reproductive health visit could help women prevent unintended pregnancy. Objective: This study examined how the association between both current and past depressive symptoms and effectiveness level of contraceptive method selected at a clinic visit varies by type of reproductive health visit. Methods: Current and past depressive symptoms and contraceptive method selected were assessed among 1215 women aged 18–25 years seeking general reproductive health or abortion services at 40 community clinics throughout the United States. Using standard categories of effectiveness based on pregnancy rates during typical use, women's contraceptive method selected was coded as a low (e.g., no method, withdrawal, condoms), moderately (pill, patch, ring, or shot), or highly effective method (IUD, sterilization, implant). Depression status was divided into four categories: 1) no elevated depressive symptoms ever, 2) current elevated depressive symptoms only, 3) past elevated depressive symptoms only, and 4) past and current elevated depressive symptoms. Visit type, general reproductive health versus abortion care, was a moderator. The interaction effect between depressive symptoms and visit type on contraceptive method effectiveness level chosen was estimated with multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results: In general reproductive health visits, having both elevated current and past depressive symptoms increased women's likelihood of choosing low versus moderately effective methods (RRR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.31 to 13.71, p < .0005). In contrast, among abortion patients, only current elevated depressive symptoms were associated with choosing high versus moderate effectiveness methods (RRR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.86, p = .029). Conclusion: Results suggest that considering both women's current and past elevated depressive symptoms and the type of reproductive health visit may assist providers in helping women prevent unintended pregnancy.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Women’s mental health and well-being 5 years after receiving or being denied an abortion: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study' by M. Antonia Biggs, Ushma D. Upadhyay, Charles E. McCulloch and Diana G. Foster (JAMA Psychiatry, 2017[Feb][1], Vol 74[2], 169-178). In the original article, incorrect statistics (numbers, percentages, and a P value) were inadvertently included in a sentence in the text. In the first paragraph of the Results section, the fourth sentence should have read: 'By the final interview wave (wave 11), women in the turn away-birth group (82 of 161 [50.9%]) were marginally less likely to participate than those in the near-limit group (270 of 452 [59.7%]; P = .053).' This article was corrected online and in print. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2017-10786-006[/rid]). Importance: The idea that abortion leads to adverse psychological outcomes has been the basis for legislation mandating counseling before obtaining an abortion and other policies to restrict access to abortion. Objective: To assess women’s psychological well-being 5 years after receiving or being denied an abortion. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study presents data from the Turnaway Study, a prospective longitudinal study with a quasi-experimental design. Women were recruited from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010, from 30 abortion facilities in 21 states throughout the United States, interviewed via telephone 1 week after seeking an abortion, and then interviewed semiannually for 5 years, totaling 11 interview waves. Interviews were completed January 31, 2016. We examined the psychological trajectories of women who received abortions just under the facility’s gestational limit (near-limit group) and compared them with women who sought but were denied an abortion because they were just beyond the facility gestational limit (turnaway group, which includes the turnaway-birth and turnaway-no-birth groups). We used mixed effects linear and logistic regression analyses to assess whether psychological trajectories differed by study group. Main Outcomes and Measures: We included 6 measures of mental health and well-being: 2 measures of depression and 2 measures of anxiety assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory, as well as self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Results: Of the 956 women (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [5.8] years) in the study, at 1 week after seeking an abortion, compared with the near-limit group, women denied an abortion reported more anxiety symptoms (turnaway-births, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.13; turnaway-no-births, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.18), lower self-esteem (turnaway-births, –0.33; 95% CI, –0.56 to –0.09; turnaway-no-births, –0.40; 95% CI, –0.78 to –0.02), lower life satisfaction (turnaway-births, –0.16; 95% CI, –0.38 to 0.06; turnaway-no-births, –0.41; 95% CI, –0.77 to –0.06), and similar levels of depression (turnaway-births, 0.13; 95% CI, –0.46 to 0.72; turnaway-no-births, 0.44; 95% CI, –0.50 to 1.39). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, compared with having an abortion, being denied an abortion may be associated with greater risk of initially experiencing adverse psychological outcomes. Psychological well-being improved over time so that both groups of women eventually converged. These findings do not support policies that restrict women’s access to abortion on the basis that abortion harms women’s mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: Women are almost twice as likely as men to develop frailty and early-traumatic experiences related to reproduction may have a role to play. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between a history of induced abortions and risk of frailty. Methods: 1062 women aged ≥ 65 years from the HELIAD study were included in the present cross-sectional study. Frailty was assessed by frailty index and Fried definitions. The history of abortion and of other reproductive experiences (age onset of menstruation, age of menopause, number of offspring, and number of miscarriages) was obtained by all participants. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine whether the number of abortions was related to frailty. Results: When frailty was defined with frailty index, women with 1 or 2 abortions had 1.7 higher risk of frailty compared to women with no history of abortions, while those with more than 3 abortions had more than a twofold higher risk of frailty. Two supplementary analyses excluding women with surgical operations’ history and women with dementia revealed similar results. When frailty was defined with Fried definition, the analysis was marginally significant when abortion was inserted as a categorical variable. Women with more than 3 abortions showed 2.4 higher risk of frailty compared to women with no history of abortion. Conclusion: The number of induced abortions was associated with moderate higher odds of frailty, when frailty was defined according to frailty index. A similar trend was revealed in the model with Fried definition after trichotomization of abortions. © 2018, European Geriatric Medicine Society.

AB  - In the last decades various methods to terminate pregnancy have been widely introduced in the Kyrgyz Republic, but little attention has been paid to their impact on the psychological status of a woman. Objective. To determine the rate of depressive disorders and to compare psychological outcomes in women before and after termination of early-stage non-developing pregnancy. Subjects and methods. This was a non-blinded randomized cohort trial. A sample consisted of 633 women at less than 12 weeks+6 days of gestation; of these, 399 women had non-developed pregnancy. Testing was carried out using the Tsung pre-diagnosis depression scale. Results. The pre-abortion rate of psychological disorders was 30.3%. There were 72.9% of mild depression cases in the structure of depressive disorders. The post-abortion rate of depression was increased by 6.0%. Following medical abortion with mefipristone in combination with misoprostol, the rate of mild depressive disorders (36.4%) was, with high statistical significance, greater than that with misoprostol alone (22.3%) (φemr 2.598; P < 0.01) and surgical abortion (20.2%) (φemr 2.872; P < 0.001). Conclusion. The high level of depressive disorders in women with early pregnancy suggests that there is a need to elaborate programs for the early detection of psychological disorders and the choice of an abortion method. © 2017, Bionika Media Ltd.

AB  - To determine the socioeconomic consequences of receipt versus denial of abortion. Women who presented for abortion just before or after the gestational age limit of 30 abortion facilities across the United States between 2008 and 2010 were recruited and followed for 5 years via semiannual telephone interviews. Using mixed effects models, we evaluated socioeconomic outcomes for 813 women by receipt or denial of abortion care. In analyses that adjusted for the few baseline differences, women denied abortions who gave birth had higher odds of poverty 6 months after denial (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.77;P< .001) than did women who received abortions;women denied abortions were also more likely to be in poverty for 4 years after denial of abortion. Six months after denial of abortion, women were less likely to be employed full time (AOR = 0.37;P = .001) and were more likely to receive public assistance (AOR = 6.26; P<.001) than were women who obtained abortions, differences that remained significant for 4 years. Women denied an abortion were more likely than were women who received an abortion to experience economic hardship and insecurity lasting years. Laws that restrict access to abortion may result in worsened economic outcomes for women.

AB  - Objective: Pregnancy loss is associated with numerous psychological sequelae. The aim of this study is to examine patients with recent pregnancy loss for possible psychiatric diagnoses and the associated psychopathology. Features of post abortion syndrome were also examined for. Methods: Forty seven patients referred to a perinatal psychiatric service following recent termination of pregnancy or miscarriage consented for this prospective case notes review. Data on demographic characteristics, clinical history and management was collected, as well as detailed case histories of women diagnosed with post-abortion syndrome. Results: About two-thirds were between ages 31 to 40 years. Majority (87.2%) was married and childless. Seventy percent did not have previous psychiatric history. Ten patients were suspected to have post abortion syndrome, presenting with guilt, self-blame and having to hide terminations from spouses. Discussion: These findings describe the characteristics of patients who are at risk of developing psychiatric conditions after pregnancy loss. Surveillance for such factors may enable earlier detection and diagnosis.

N1  - Julia Littell (2024-10-11 03:37:50)(Screen): Conference abstract: "Objectives: We use data that do not rely on self-report and consider prior mental health to examine the association between abortion and suicide attempts.
Methods: Using Danish Population Registries, we linked data for
523,280 women who were 18 to 36 years old between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016. In survival analyses, we examined whether having had an abortion increased women’s risk of first-time suicide attempts—defined as a suicide attempt or self-injurious behavior according to the Danish algorithm—and whether this risk changed over time from the abortion, adjusting for important covariates such as age, calendar year, childbirth history, mental health history, parental mental health history, a physical health indicator, and parental education level.
Results: Women who had had an abortion had a higher risk of
having a suicidal attempt than did women who had not had an
abortion. However, this risk relative to women not having had an
abortion was the same in the year before and the year after an
abortion (IRR=2.46, 95% CI 2.22–2.72 vs. IRR=2.54, 95% CI 2.29–2.81, p=.509) and decreased as time from the abortion increased (IRR=1.90, 95% CI 1.75–2.06 for 1–5 years afterward vs. IRR=1.73, 95% CI 1.53–1.96 for N5 years afterward).
Conclusions: Women who have had an abortion are more likely to
have suicide attempts both before and after their abortion than are women who have had no abortions. However, the higher likelihood among women having had an abortion is not attributable to their abortion.;

AB  - MEDLINE Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare social and emotional adjustment including educational attainment and substance use in women who had a child, pregnancy termination, or miscarriage by young adulthood. METHODS: Data were from a population-based longitudinal study of the health and well-being of 1,943 young Australians (Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study) followed from 15 to 24 years of age. The sample was restricted to female participants and based on pregnancies reported by age 24 years. Analyses were adjusted for early teenage depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, cannabis use, and parent socioeconomic context. RESULTS: A total of 208 pregnancies (in 170 women) were reported from a sample of 824 young women by 24 years of age. Compared with those who had never been pregnant, those who had a child had lower tertiary education completion and a higher risk of nicotine dependence; those who terminated a pregnancy were more commonly single and had a higher risk of smoking and alcohol use as well as nicotine and alcohol dependence; and those who had a miscarriage had a higher risk of depressive symptomatology and binge drinking as well as nicotine and cannabis dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Young women who have been pregnant by their mid-twenties report a range of difficulties in social and emotional adjustment that vary across the different pregnancy outcomes. Broad-based psychosocial health care is essential not only for young women whose pregnancies proceed to live birth, but also for those whose pregnancies end with miscarriage or induced abortion

AB  - Determine the psychosocial and clinical factors that are associated with psychiatric morbidity among women with infertility attending a Nigerian gynaecology clinic. Use a proforma and a screening instrument, General Health Questionnaire version 30 (GHQ-30). Interview all probable cases with a score of 5 or more on GHQ-30 using the Present State Examination (PSE). Make psychiatric diagnosis accordance with the diagnostic criteria of the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Find that the infertility rate among the study group was found to be 25.8% with primary and secondary infertility rates constituting 21.9% and 78.1% respectively. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among women with infertility (48.8%) was significantly more than that in the control group, that lack of support from husband, lack of support from husbandÆs relatives, discrimination and history of induced abortion were significantly associated with psychiatric morbidity among patients with infertility when compared with the fertile control population, but that there was no significant difference in the rate of psychiatric morbidity between women with primary infertility and those with secondary infertility. Conclude that psychiatric morbidity is significantly more common among patients with infertility as compared with those without. There was a significant association between psychiatric morbidity and absence of support from husband and his relations, presence of discrimination, and a history of induced abortion. We suggest more public enlightenment on the needfor moral/ psychosocial support to women with infertility. In addition, more efforts should be made towards early screening and identification of cases of psychiatric morbidity among patients with infertility

AB  - MEDLINE Abstract: BACKGROUND:<BR>Depression during pregnancy is a major health problem because it is prevalent and chronic, and its impact on birth outcome and child health is serious. Several psychosocial and obstetric factors have been identified as predictors. Evidence on the prevalence and predictors of antenatal depression is very limited in Ethiopia. This study aims to determine prevalence and associated factors with antenatal depression.<BR>METHODS:<BR>Community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 527 pregnant women recruited in a cluster sampling method. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews on socio-demographic, obstetric, and psychosocial characteristics. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The List of Threatening Experiences questionnaire (LTE-Q) and the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSS-3) were used to assess stressful events and social support, respectively. Data were entered into Epi-info and analyzed using SPSS-20. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were carried out.<BR>RESULTS:<BR>The prevalence of antenatal depression was found to be 11.8%. Having debt (OR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.33, 5.85), unplanned pregnancy (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = (1.20, 4.76), history of stillbirth (OR = 3.97, 95% CI = (1.67,9.41), history of abortion (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.005, 6.61), being in the third trimester of pregnancy (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.07,2.72), presence of a complication in the current pregnancy (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.66,6.53), and previous history of depression (OR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.71,7.06) were factors significantly associated with antenatal depression.<BR>CONCLUSION:<BR>The prevalence of antenatal depression was high, especially in the third trimester. Poverty, unmet reproductive health needs, and obstetric complications are the main determinants of antenatal depression. For early detection and appropriate intervention, screening for depression during the routine antenatal care should be promoted.<BR>

AB  - MEDLINE Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little is known about the reproductive health of women who survive obstetric complications in poor countries. Our aim was to determine how severe obstetric complications in Burkina Faso affect reproductive events in the first year postpartum. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective cohort of women who either experienced life threatening (near-miss) pregnancy-related complications or an uncomplicated childbirth, followed from the end of pregnancy to one year postpartum or post-abortum. Documented outcomes include menses resumption, sexual activity resumption, dyspareunia, uptake of contraceptives, unmet needs for contraception and women's reproductive intentions.Participants were recruited in seven hospitals between December 2004 and March 2005 in six towns in Burkina Faso. RESULTS: Reproductive events were associated with pregnancy outcome. The frequency of contraceptive use was low in all groups and the method used varied according to the presence or not of a live baby. The proportion with unmet need for contraception was high and varied according to the time since end of pregnancy. Desire for another pregnancy was highest among near-miss women with perinatal death or natural abortion. Women in the near-miss group with induced abortion, perinatal death and natural abortion had significantly higher odds of subsequent pregnancy. Unintended pregnancies were observed mainly in women in the near-miss group with live birth and the uncomplicated delivery group. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the potential deleterious impact (on health and socio-economic life) of new pregnancies in near-miss women, it is important to ensure family planning coverage includes those who survive a severe complication

AB  - Background              This study prospectively assesses the mental health outcomes among women seeking abortions, by comparing women having later abortions with women denied abortions, up to 2 years post-abortion seeking.              Method              We present the first 2 years of a 5-year telephone interview study that is following 956 women who sought an abortion from 30 facilities throughout the USA. We use adjusted linear mixed-effects regression analyses to assess whether symptoms of depression and anxiety, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory-short form and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire, differ over time among women denied an abortion due to advanced gestational age, compared with women who received abortions.              Results              Baseline predicted mean depressive symptom scores for women denied abortion (3.07) were similar to women receiving an abortion just below the gestational limit (2.86). Depressive symptoms declined over time, with no difference between groups. Initial predicted mean anxiety symptoms were higher among women denied care (2.59) than among women who had an abortion just below the gestational limit (1.91). Anxiety levels in the two groups declined and converged after 1 year.              Conclusions              Women who received an abortion had similar or lower levels of depression and anxiety than women denied an abortion. Our findings do not support the notion that abortion is a cause of mental health problems.

AB  - Background: Some research finds that women receiving abortions are at increased risk of subsequent drug use and drug use disorders. This literature is rife with methodological problems, particularly inappropriate comparison groups. Methods: This study used data from the Turnaway Study, a prospective, longitudinal study of women who sought abortions at 30 sites across the U.S. Participants included women presenting just prior to an abortion facility's gestational age limit who received abortions (Near Limit Abortion Group, n = 452), just beyond the gestational limit who were denied abortions (Turnaways, n = 231), and who received first trimester abortions (First Trimester Abortion Group, n = 273). This study examined the relationship between receiving versus being denied an abortion and subsequent drug use over two years. Trajectories of drug use were compared using multivariate mixed effects regression. Results: Any drug use, frequency of drug use, and marijuana use did not change over time among women in any group. There were no differential changes over time in any drug use, frequency of drug use, or marijuana use between groups. However, Turnaways who ultimately gave birth increased use of drugs other than marijuana compared to women in the Near Limit Abortion Group (p = .041), who did not increase use. Conclusion: Women receiving abortions did not increase drug use over two years or have higher levels of drug use than women denied abortions. Assertions that abortion leads women to use drugs to cope with the stress of abortion are not supported. [Copyright Elsevier Ireland Ltd.]

AB  - Prior research has focused primarily on the mental health consequences of abortion; little is known about mental health before abortion. In this study, the psychiatric history of women who have had an abortion is investigated. 325 Women who recently had an abortion were compared with 1902 women from the population-based Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-2). Lifetime prevalence estimates of various mental disorders were measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Compared to the reference sample, women in the abortion sample were three times more likely to report a history of any mental disorder (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 2.36-3.98). The highest odds were found for conduct disorder (OR = 6.97, 95% CI = 4.41-11.01) and drug dependence (OR = 4.96, 95% CI = 2.55-9.66). Similar results were found for lifetime-minus-last-year prevalence estimates and for women who had first-time abortions only. The results support the notion that psychiatric history may explain associations that have been found between abortion and mental health. Psychiatric history should therefore be taken into account when investigating the mental health consequences of abortion. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

PD  - 
AB  - The notion that abortion causes poor mental health has gained traction, even though it is not supported by research. Few studies have comprehensively investigated women's postabortion emotions. Baseline data from a longitudinal study of women seeking abortion at 30 U.S. facilities between 2008 and 2010 were used to examine emotions among 843 women who received an abortion just prior to the facility's gestational age limit, were denied an abortion because they presented just beyond the gestational limit or obtained a first-trimester abortion. Multivariable analyses were used to compare women's emotions about their pregnancy and about their receipt or denial of abortion after one week, and to identify variables associated with experiencing primarily negative emotions postabortion. Compared with women who obtained a near-limit abortion, those denied the abortion felt more regret and anger (scoring, on average, 0.4-0.5 points higher on a 0-4 scale), and less relief and happiness (scoring 1.4 and 0.3 points lower, respectively). Among women who had obtained the abortion, the greater the extent to which they had planned the pregnancy or had difficulty deciding to seek abortion, the more likely they were to feel primarily negative emotions (odds ratios, 1.2 and 2.5, respectively). Most (95%) women who had obtained the abortion felt it was the right decision, as did 89% of those who expressed regret. Difficulty with the abortion decision and the degree to which the pregnancy had been planned were most important for women's postabortion emotional state. Experiencing negative emotions postabortion is different from believing that abortion was not the right decision. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The psychological impact of abortion is a controversial issue. While some studies indicate that women who had elective abortions present lower psychological distress when compared with those who had spontaneous or therapeutic abortions, other studies found abortion to be associated with significant psychological distress. To assess psychological adjustment (emotional disorder, trauma symptoms and couple relationship) one and six months after abortion, and gender differences regarding psychological adjustment, and to assess the moderation role of couple relationship in the effect of the etiology of abortion on emotional disorder and trauma symptoms. Women (n=50) with different etiologies of abortion agreed to participate, as well as 15 partners (N=65). Assessments took place one and six months after abortion. Measures included the Brief Symptoms Inventory, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Relationship Questionnaire. A decrease in emotional disorder for all etiologies of abortion and an increase in perceived quality of couple relationship in therapeutic abortion were observed over time. Couple relationship moderates the effect of the etiology of abortion on trauma symptoms one month after abortion. Psychological adjustment after abortion seems not to be exclusively related to its etiology, being influenced by other factors such as couple relationship.

AB  - Women are not at increased risk of being treated for a mental disorder following a first-time, first-trimester abortion, according to a study that used data from Danish national registries. However, women's risk of mental disorder is elevated following their first live birth. The incidence rates of first-time psychiatric contact among females who had an abortion in 1995-2007 were statistically indistinguishable before and after the abortion (14.6 and 15.2 per 1,000 person-years, respectively), whereas the rate jumped significantly between the time preceding and the period following childbirth (from 3.9 to 6.7 per 1,000 person-years). The increase in the risk postpartum was most dramatic in the early months following delivery. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - CONTEXT: A 2008 report by the American Psychological Association found no evidence that an induced abortion causes mental health problems in adult women. No conclusions were drawn with respect to adolescents because of a scarcity of evidence. METHODS: Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to examine whether abortion in adolescence was associated with subsequent depression and low self-esteem. In all, 289 female respondents reported at least one pregnancy between Wave 1 (1994-1995) and Wave 2 (1996) of the survey. Of these, 69 reported an induced abortion. Population-averaged lagged logistic regression models were used to assess associations between abortion and depression and low self-esteem within a year of the pregnancy and approximately five years later, at Wave 3 (2001-2002). RESULTS: Abortion was not associated with depression or low self-esteem at either time point. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics did not substantially modify the relationships between abortion and the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who have an abortion do not appear to be at elevated risk for depression or low self-esteem in the short term or up to five years after the abortion.

AB  - In countries where legal abortion is restricted, many unwanted pregnancies are carried to term. Attempting an unsuccessful abortion may influence women's mental health. This study investigated the common mental disorders (CMDs) of depression and anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy in women who wanted or had attempted an abortion in a poor region of Brazil. CMDs were assessed by using the 20-item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) in all pregnant women aged 18-49 years who were registered with publicly funded primary health care in Recife, Northeast Brazil. The study achieved a high response rate and 1121 (98.9%) women completed the interview. The prevalence of CMDs for the sample was 43.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.2-46.1], and 63.6% (95% CI 55.4-71.2) among the 13.7% of women who attempted an abortion. The association between CMDs and attempted an abortion [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% CI 1.3-3.1] remained after adjustment for confounders. This study found that attempting an abortion in the current pregnancy was associated with CMDs. Good access to family planning programs, including access to contraceptive methods and safe abortion, should help to improve the mental health of women. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background There has been continued interest in the extent to which women have positive and negative reactions to abortion. Aims To document emotional reactions to abortion, and to examine the links between reactions to abortion and subsequent mental health outcomes. Method Data were gathered on the pregnancy and mental health history of a birth cohort of over 500 women studied to the age of 30. Results Abortion was associated with high rates of both positive and negative emotional reactions; however, nearly 90% of respondents believed that the abortion was the right decision. Analyses showed that the number of negative responses to the abortion was associated with increased levels of subsequent mental health disorders (P<0.05). Further analyses suggested that, after adjustment for confounding, those having an abortion and reporting negative reactions had rates of mental health disorders that were approximately 1.4-1.8 times higher than those not having an abortion. Conclusions Abortion was associated with both positive and negative emotional reactions. The extent of negative emotional reactions appeared to modify the links between abortion and subsequent mental health problems. Declaration of Interest None. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between abortion history and a wide range of anxiety (panic disorder, panic attacks, PTSD, Agoraphobia), mood (bipolar disorder, mania, major depression), and substance abuse disorders (alcohol and drug abuse and dependence) using a nationally representative US sample, the national comorbidity survey. Abortion was found to be related to an increased risk for a variety of mental health problems (panic attacks, panic disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, bipolar disorder, major depression with and without hierarchy), and substance abuse disorders after statistical controls were instituted for a wide range of personal, situational, and demographic variables. Calculation of population attributable risks indicated that abortion was implicated in between 4.3% and 16.6% of the incidence of these disorders. Future research is needed to identify mediating mechanisms linking abortion to various disorders and to understand individual difference factors associated with vulnerability to developing a particular mental health problem after abortion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Possible effects of termination of pregnancy (TOP) on mental health are a matter of debate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed anxiety and quality of life during a one‐year follow up after first‐trimester TOP using the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Scale and EuroQoL Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ‐5D, EQ‐VAS) in 742 women participating in a randomized controlled trial on early provision of intrauterine contraception. The measurements were performed before TOP, at 3 months and 1 year after TOP. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, residence in Helsinki, duration of gestation <12 weeks, non‐medical indication for TOP, and approval of intrauterine contraception. The trial was registered with Clinical Trials [NCT01223521]. RESULTS: When compared with baseline, the overall anxiety level was significantly lower and quality of life higher at 3 months and at 1 year. Reduction of anxiety and improvement of quality of life was especially evident (p < 0.001) in the 58% of women reporting clinically relevant anxiety at baseline. High levels of anxiety at baseline, history of psychiatric morbidity and smoking predicted significantly greater risk of poorer quality of life and elevated level of anxiety during the follow up. CONCLUSIONS: TOP is associated with a significant overall reduction of anxiety and an improvement of quality of life among women undergoing it for non‐medical indications. High baseline anxiety, history of psychiatric morbidity and smoking are risk factors of persistently high levels of anxiety and poor quality of life after an induced abortion. These data are important when designing and providing post‐abortion care.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, venlafaxine or other antidepressants is associated with late elective termination of pregnancy.Design: Case-control study using data from national registers.Setting: Denmark, Finland, and Norway during the period 1996-2007.Population: A total of 14,902 women were included as cases and 148,929 women were included as controls.Methods: Cases were women with elective termination of pregnancy at 12-23 weeks of gestation. Controls continued their pregnancy and were matched with cases on key factors.Main Outcome Measures: Association between antidepressant use during pregnancy and elective termination of pregnancy at 12-23 weeks of gestation for fetal anomalies, or for maternal ill health or socio-economic disadvantage.Results: At least one prescription of antidepressants was filled by 3.7% of the cases and 2.2% of the controls. Use of any type of antidepressant was associated with elective termination of pregnancy for maternal ill health or socio-economic disadvantage (odds ratio, OR 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 2.0-2.5). Elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies was associated with the use of mirtazapine (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5). There was no association between the use of any of the other antidepressants and elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies.Conclusion: The use of any type of antidepressants was associated with elective termination of pregnancy at 12-23 weeks for maternal ill health or socio-economic disadvantage, but not with terminations for fetal anomalies. Further studies need to confirm the findings concerning mirtazapine and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies.

AB  - Objectives. We set out to assess the occurrence of new depression and anxiety diagnoses in women 3 years after they sought an abortion. Methods. We conducted semiannual telephone interviews of 956 women who sought abortions from 30 US facilities. Adjusted multivariable discrete-time logistic survival models examined whether the study group (women who obtained abortions just under a facility's gestational age limit, who were denied abortions and carried to term, who were denied abortions and did not carry to term, and who received first-trimester abortions) predicted depression or anxiety onset during seven 6-month time intervals. Results. The 3-year cumulative probability of professionally diagnosed depression was 9% to 14%; for anxiety it was 10% to 15%, with no study group differences. Women in the first-trimester group and women denied abortions who did not give birth had greater odds of new self-diagnosed anxiety than did women who obtained abortions just under facility gestational limits. Conclusions. Among women seeking abortions near facility gestational limits, those who obtained abortions were at no greater mental health risk than were women who carried an unwanted pregnancy to term.

AB  - We conducted a survey of 358 young migrant women working in entertainment venues in China to explore the prevalence of and factors associated with two indicators of sexual and reproductive health: (1) multiple abortions and (2) the dual risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and abortion history. One quarter (25.4 percent) of the women in this sample had multiple abortions during their lifetime and, of those with any abortion history, 18.3 percent had had an abortion outside of a regulated health clinic. One-third (33.0 percent) of the sample had had an STI during the past year, and approximately one-fourth (23.7 percent) of those women did not receive STI treatment in a public hospital. Approximately one-fourth (23.5 percent) of the sample reported both a history of abortion and an STI during the past year. Women with a history of multiple abortions had significantly lower income levels, were more likely to have sex with clients and with husbands, and tended more to use alcohol before sex. Women who experienced both abortion and STI risks were more likely to report having had unprotected sex, genitourinary tract infections symptoms, anxiety, illicit drug use, and suicidal ideation. Enhanced efforts are needed to improve reproductive and sexual health for female migrants in urban China, particularly those working in entertainment venues.

AB  - Aim: Research finds women who terminate pregnancies are at risk of subsequent problematic alcohol use, but methodological and conceptual problems are common. This study examines the relationship between receiving versus being denied termination and subsequent alcohol use. Methods: Data are from a prospective, longitudinal study of US women seeking pregnancy terminations. Participants presented just before a facility’s gestational limit and received terminations (Near Limits, n = 452) or just beyond the limit and were denied terminations (Turnaways, n = 231). Results: Groups did not differ in alcohol use before pregnancy recognition. One week after termination- seeking (Turnaways still pregnant, Near Limits not), Turnaways had lower odds of any and binge alcohol use, but did not differ on 1+ problem symptoms. Over 2.5 years, both Near Limits and Turnaways increased any and binge alcohol use, with Turnaways increasing more rapidly. The groups did not converge again on any or binge use. For Near Limits, any alcohol use surpassed the pre-pregnancy recognition level, but binge use did not. Changes in problem symptoms over time were not evident for either group. Conclusion: While women who had a termination were more likely to report any and binge alcohol use than women who had a child, this difference was due to a reduction in consumption among women having the child rather than an increase in consumption among women having a termination. Thus, assertions that having a termination leads women to increase alcohol use to cope with having had a termination are not supported.

AB  - Background: Women of reproductive age who binge drink or have alcohol-related problem symptoms (APS) and who do not use contraception are considered at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). In the U.S., efforts to prevent AEPs focus largely on delivering interventions in primary health care settings. While research suggests that these interventions are efficacious for women reached, it is unclear to what extent these interventions are likely to reach women at risk of AEPs.Methods: Data are from the Turnaway Study, a study of 956 women seeking pregnancy termination at 30 U.S. facilities between 2008 and 2010, some of whom received and some of whom were denied terminations because they were past the gestational limit. We examined associations between binge drinking, APS, and drug use prior to pregnancy recognition and having a usual source of health care (USOC).Results: Overall, 59% reported having a USOC. A smaller proportion with than without an APS reported a USOC (44 vs. 60%, p<.05) and a smaller proportion using than not using drugs reported a USOC (51 vs. 61%, p<.05). This pattern was not observed for binge drinking. In multivariate analyses, an APS continued to be associated with lack of a USOC, while drug use was no longer associated with lack of a USOC.Conclusions: As more than 40% did not have a USOC, with higher proportions among women with an APS, primary health-care based approaches to AEP prevention seem unlikely to reach the majority of women who have an APS and are at risk of an unintended pregnancy.

AB  - Background It has been recommended that psychosocial assessment (including depression screening) be integrated into routine antenatal care across Australia, but implementation in the private sector has lagged. Aims This study aimed to report preliminary outcomes associated with an antenatal psychosocial assessment and depression screening program implemented at an Australian private obstetric hospital setting and to report characteristics and correlates of elevated depression symptoms in this sample. Materials and Methods A total of 993 pregnant women (mean ± SD gestational age 27.9 ± 6.7 weeks) participated in a structured psychosocial assessment interview and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS). Results Six per cent of participants scored ≥13 on the EPDS. Psychosocial correlates of antenatal depressive symptoms included low income, history of pregnancy termination, poor practical support, lack of confidence and history of depression. Almost 1 in 10 of the total sample was referred for further assessment and clinical support. Conclusions The prevalence of clinically significant antenatal depressive symptoms in this sample highlights the importance of antenatal depression screening for all women, including those who choose to access private obstetric care.

AB  - Objective: To examine whether a first abortion increases risk of mental health disorders compared with a first childbirth with and without considering prepregnancy mental health and adverse exposures, childhood economic status, miscarriage history, age at first abortion or childbirth, and race or ethnicity.Methods: A cohort study compared rates of mental disorders (anxiety, mood, impulse-control, substance use, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation) among 259 women postabortion and 677 women postchildbirth aged 18-42 years at the time of interview from The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication.Results: The percentage of women with no, one, two, and three or more mental health disorders before their first abortion was 37.8%, 19.7%, 15.2%, and 27.3% and before their first childbirth was 57.9%, 19.6%, 9.2%, and 13.3%, respectively, indicating that women in the abortion group had more prior mental health disorders than women in the childbirth group (P<.001). Although in unadjusted Cox proportional hazard models, abortion compared with childbirth was associated with statistically significant higher hazards of postpregnancy mental health disorders, associations were reduced and became nonstatistically significant for five disorders after adjusting for the aforementioned factors. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals dropped from 1.52 (1.08-2.15) to 1.12 (0.87-1.46) for anxiety disorders; from 1.56 (1.23-1.98) to 1.18 (0.88-1.56) for mood disorders; from 1.62 (1.02-2.57) to 1.10 (0.75-1.62) for impulse-control disorders; from 2.53 (1.09-5.86) to 1.82 (0.63-5.25) for eating disorders; and from 1.62 (1.09-2.40) to 1.25 (0.88-1.78) for suicidal ideation. Only the relationship between abortion and substance use disorders remained statistically significant, although the hazard ratio dropped from 3.05 (1.94-4.79) to 2.30 (1.35-3.92).Conclusions: After accounting for confounding factors, abortion was not a statistically significant predictor of subsequent anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and eating disorders or suicidal ideation.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to assess the effects of obtaining an abortion versus being denied an abortion on self-esteem and life satisfaction.Methods: We present the first 2.5 years of a 5-year longitudinal telephone-interview study that follows 956 women who sought an abortion from 30 facilities across the USA. We examine the self-esteem and life satisfaction trajectories of women who sought and received abortions just under the facility's gestational age limit, of women who sought and received abortions in their first trimester of pregnancy, and of women who sought abortions just beyond the facility gestational limit and were denied an abortion. We use adjusted mixed effects linear regression analyses to assess whether the trajectories of women who sought and obtained an abortion differ from those who were denied one.Results: Women denied an abortion initially reported lower self-esteem and life satisfaction than women who sought and obtained an abortion. For all study groups, except those who obtained first trimester abortions, self-esteem and life satisfaction improved over time. The initially lower levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction among women denied an abortion improved more rapidly reaching similar levels as those obtaining abortions at 6 months to one year after abortion seeking. For women obtaining first trimester abortions, initially higher levels of life satisfaction remained steady over time.Conclusions: There is no evidence that abortion harms women's self-esteem or life satisfaction in the short term.

AB  - Background: Scant literature exists on whether prior pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, and/or induced abortion) increases the risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders-specifically depression and anxiety-after subsequent births. This study compares: (1) risk factors for depression and/or anxiety disorders in the postpartum year among women with and without prior pregnancy loss; and (2) rates of these disorders in women with one versus multiple pregnancy losses. Methods: One-hundred-ninety-two women recruited at first-year pediatric well-child care visits from an urban pediatric clinic provided demographic information, reproductive and health histories. They also completed depression screening tools and a standard semi-structured psychiatric diagnostic interview. Results: Almost half of the participants (49%) reported a previous pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, or induced abortion). More than half of those with a history of pregnancy loss reported more than one loss (52%). Women with prior pregnancy loss were more likely to be diagnosed with major depression ( p=0.002) than women without a history of loss. Women with multiple losses were more likely to be diagnosed with major depression ( p=0.047) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (Fisher's exact [FET]=0.028) than women with a history of one pregnancy loss. Loss type was not related to depression, although number of losses was related to the presence of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Low-income urban mothers have high rates of pregnancy loss and often have experienced more than one loss and/or more than one type of loss. Women with a history of pregnancy loss are at increased risk for depression and anxiety, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), after the birth of a child. Future research is needed to understand the reasons that previous pregnancy loss is associated with subsequent postpartum depression and anxiety among this population of women.

AB  - The suicide rate of females is very close to that of males in China, in contrast to Western societies, in which the rates of male suicide outnumber those of females by three to four times. This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and prosuicide attitude (acceptability) among females of childbearing age. With the Chinese version of the Scale for Suicide Ideation and the General Social Survey questionnaire, we examined the demographic and psychological risk factors of suicide among Chinese rural young females aged 15 to 34 years. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the factors related to suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability. The prevalence rates of suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability among the sampled females are 22.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Education, depression, social support, hopelessness, and negative life events were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Ethnicity, education, abortion, and depression were significantly associated with suicide acceptability. There is statistical difference between suicide ideation and acceptability. The results indicate that mental disorder remains a major risk factor of suicidal ideation. Sociodemographic and psychological characteristics are associated with suicide acceptability.

AB  - Objective: Most previous studies that have investigated the relation between abortion and mental illness have presented mixed findings. We examined the relation between abortion, mental disorders, and suicidality using a US nationally representative sample.Methods: Data came from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (n = 3310 women, aged 18 years and older). The World Health Organization-Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess mental disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria and lifetime abortion in women. Multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to examine associations between abortion and lifetime mood, anxiety, substance use, eating, and disruptive behaviour disorders, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. We calculated the percentage of respondents whose mental disorder came after the first abortion. The role of violence was also explored. Population attributable fractions were calculated for significant associations between abortion and mental disorders.Results: After adjusting for sociodemographics, abortion was associated with an increased likelihood of several mental disorders--mood disorders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] ranging from 1.75 to 1.91), anxiety disorders (AOR ranging from 1.87 to 1.91), substance use disorders (AOR ranging from 3.14 to 4.99), as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (AOR ranging from 1.97 to 2.18). Adjusting for violence weakened some of these associations. For all disorders examined, less than one-half of women reported that their mental disorder had begun after the first abortion. Population attributable fractions ranged from 5.8% (suicidal ideation) to 24.7% (drug abuse).Conclusions: Our study confirms a strong association between abortion and mental disorders. Possible mechanisms of this relation are discussed.

AB  - Abstract: Using the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), published an analysis indicating that compared to women who had never had an abortion, women who had reported an abortion were at an increased risk of several anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Here, we show that those results are not replicable. That is, using the same data, sample, and codes as indicated by those authors, it is not possible to replicate the simple bivariate statistics testing the relationship of ever having had an abortion to each mental health disorder when no factors were controlled for in analyses ( in ). Furthermore, among women with prior pregnancies in the NCS, we investigated whether having zero, one, or multiple abortions (abortion history) was associated with having a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder at the time of the interview. In doing this, we tested two competing frameworks: the abortion-as-trauma versus the common-risk-factors approach. Our results support the latter framework. In the bivariate context when no other factors were included in models, abortion history was not related to having a mood disorder, but it was related to having an anxiety or substance use disorder. When prior mental health and violence experience were controlled in our models, no significant relation was found between abortion history and anxiety disorders. When these same risk factors and other background factors were controlled, women who had multiple abortions remained at an increased risk of having a substance use disorder compared to women who had no abortions, likely because we were unable to control for other risk factors associated with having an abortion and substance use. Policy, practice, and research should focus on assisting women at greatest risk of having unintended pregnancies and having poor mental health—those with violence in their lives and prior mental health problems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare psychiatric morbidity and the course of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety in two groups with severe complications during pregnancy, women after termination of late pregnancy (TOP) due to fetal anomalies and women after preterm birth (PRE). As control group women after the delivery of a healthy child were assessed. A consecutive sample of women who experienced a) termination of late pregnancy in the 2nd or 3rd-trimester (N = 62), or b) preterm birth (N = 43), or c) birth of a healthy child (N = 65) was investigated 14 days (T1), 6 months (T2), and 14 months (T3) after the event. At T1, 22.4% of the women after TOP were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder compared to 18.5% women after PRE, and 6.2% in the control group. The corresponding values at T3 were 16.7%, 7.1%, and 0%. Shortly after the event, a broad spectrum of diagnoses was found; however, 14 months later only affective and anxiety disorders were diagnosed. Posttraumatic stress and clinician-rated depressive symptoms were highest in women after TOP. The short-term emotional reactions to TOP in late pregnancy due to fetal anomaly appear to be more intense than those to preterm birth. Both events can lead to severe psychiatric morbidity with a lasting psychological impact.

AB  - Aim: Women with a recent induced abortion have a 3-fold risk for suicide, compared to non-pregnant women. The increased risk was recognised in unofficial guidelines (1996) and Current Care Guidelines (2001) on abortion treatment, highlighting the importance of a check-up 2 – 3 weeks after the termination, to monitor for mental health disorders. We studied the suicide trends after induced abortion in 1987 – 2012 in Finland. Methods: We linked the Register on Induced Abortions (N = 284,751) and Cause-of-Death Register (N = 3798 suicides) to identify women who had committed suicide within 1 year after an induced abortion (N = 79). The abortion rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated for 1987 – 1996 (period with no guidelines), 1997 – 2001 (with unofficial guidelines) and 2002 – 2012 (with Current Care Guidelines). Results: The suicide rate after induced abortion declined by 24%, from 32.4/100,000 in 1987 – 1996 to 24.3/100,000 in 1997 – 2001 and then 24.8/100,000 in 2002 – 2012. The age-adjusted suicide rate among women aged 15 – 49 decreased by 13%; from 11.4/100,000 to 10.4/100,000 and 9.9/100,000, respectively. After induced abortions, the suicide rate increased by 30% among teenagers (to 25/100,000), stagnated for women aged 20 – 24 (at 32/100,000), but decreased by 43% (to 21/100,000) for women aged 25 – 49. Conclusions: The excess risk for suicide after induced abortion decreased, but the change was not statistically significant. Women with a recent induced abortion still have a 2-fold suicide risk. A mandatory check-up may decrease this risk. The causes for the increased suicide risk, including mental health prior to pregnancy and the social circumstances, should be investigated further.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of depressive symptomatology in early postnatal period and its relationship with obstetric risk factors. Material and Methodology: This is a cross sectional study involving 293 women from postnatal ward Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM), Malaysia. They were screened for depression at day 1 to day 5 postpartum and 4 to 6 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). At the first visit, the women completed questionnaires on socio-demography and obstetric risk factors and Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (BPHQ-9). At the second visit which is 4-6 weeks postpartum, they only completed EPDS. Results: Two hundred and ninety-three women successfully completed the study (100% response rates). The prevalence of PND at 4-6 weeks postpartum using the EPDS score of 12 or more was 27.3%. Women with the history of abortion (p < 0.05) and early postnatal depression (p < 0.05) was significantly associated with PND. Conclusion: Postnatal depression among women in Hospital USM was more common compared to previously reported series in Malaysia. Women with the history of abortion and early postnatal depression were significantly associated with PND.

AB  - Iran has had replacement fertility since 2000. Upholding a small family size has led some couples to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Abortion is, however, permitted only on medical grounds in Iran. Using data from the Iran Low Fertility Survey, this study assessed sociodemographic correlates of abortion among a random sample of 5526 ever-married women aged 15-54 years, and used in-depth interviews to explore reasons for and psychological consequences of abortion among 40 women who had experienced an unintended pregnancy. Although social and economic concerns were the main reasons cited for seeking abortion, women experienced anxiety and depression when seeking pregnancy termination and thereafter. Social stigmatization arose from a belief that abortion is sinful and that misfortune experienced thereafter is punishment. Inadequate knowledge and misunderstanding of relevant Sharia laws discouraged women from seeking care when they experienced complications. Iran's reproductive health policies should be revised to integrate pre- and postabortion counseling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Examining the risk factors for subsequent mental health sequelae in female adolescents hospitalized for induced abortion, the composition of mental disorders present in patients, the interaction between reproductive and mental health. METHOD(S): The study, from an observational, descriptive and analytical point of view, examines data contained in the hospital discharge records (Schede di Dimissione Ospedaliera, SDO) of adolescents hospitalized for a first induced abortion (n. 19991) or for a first normal delivery (n. 22342). Within the SDOs of the two groups, included in the Epidemiologic and Economic Atlas of Hospital Activities in Lombardy (Atlante Lombardo Epidemiologico ed Economico dell'Attivita Ospedaliera, ALEE -AO vers. 9.0), the records bearing the diagnosis of mental disorder in medical history or at hospital discharge have been isolated by ICD 9CM codes. The measures used were: number of evaluated patients per ten thousand, crude age-specific index, Odds Ratio with 95% CI, Fischer's test. RESULTLTS: An increased presence of such risk factors was detected in abortion group, as mental disorders in medical history or at discharge, low age at gestational event. The gestational outcome did not appear to be significant in itself after case-control analysis. The distribution of disorders in this group is characterized by the predominance of drug dependence over episodic mood disorders, by the predominance of mental disorders detected at discharge over those diagnosed in history, and by the predominance of cases in patients aged 15-19 over 20-24 and 10-14 age groups. CONCLUSION(S): The results highlight the need to detect during a gestational event in adolescence the presence of risk factors for mental health sequelae that may persist or recur at prolonged time intervals. The findings point towards the need for preventive interventions both appropriate to the complexity of the interaction between the different expressions of adolescent distress and characterized by the integration of services for reproductive and mental health.Copyright © 2015 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

PD  - 
AB  - Objective: To examine the links between pregnancy outcomes (birth, abortion, or involuntary pregnancy loss) and mental health outcomes for US women during the transition into adulthood to determine the extent of increased risk, if any, associated with exposure to induced abortion. Method(s): Panel data on pregnancy history and mental health history for a nationally representative cohort of 8005 women at (average) ages 15, 22, and 28 years from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health were examined for risk of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, cannabis abuse, and nicotine dependence by pregnancy outcome (birth, abortion, and involuntary pregnancy loss). Risk ratios were estimated for time-dynamic outcomes from population-averaged longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models. Result(s): After extensive adjustment for confounding, other pregnancy outcomes, and sociodemographic differences, abortion was consistently associated with increased risk of mental health disorder. Overall risk was elevated 45% (risk ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.62; p < 0.0001). Risk of mental health disorder with pregnancy loss was mixed, but also elevated 24% (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.37; p < 0.0001) overall. Birth was weakly associated with reduced mental disorders. One-eleventh (8.7%; 95% confidence interval, 6.0-11.3) of the prevalence of mental disorders examined over the period were attributable to abortion. Conclusion(s): Evidence from the United States confirms previous findings from Norway and New Zealand that, unlike other pregnancy outcomes, abortion is consistently associated with a moderate increase in risk of mental health disorders during late adolescence and early adulthood.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Background: Health insurance claims are a rich data source to examine medication use in pregnancy. Our objective was to identify pregnant women, their pregnancy outcomes, and date of their last menstrual period (LMP), and to estimate antidepressant dispensations in pregnancy. Method(s): From a literature search, we identified diagnosis and procedure codes indicating the end of a pregnancy. Using Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Databases, we identified all inpatient admissions and outpatient service claims with these codes. We developed an algorithm to assign: (1) pregnancy outcome (ectopic pregnancy, induced or spontaneous abortion, live birth, or stillbirth), and (2) estimated gestational age, to each inpatient or outpatient visit. For each pregnancy outcome, we estimated the LMP as the admission (for inpatient visits) or service (for outpatient visits) date minus the gestational age. To differentiate visits associated with separate pregnancies, we required >= 2 months between one pregnancy outcomes and the LMP of the next pregnancy. We used this algorithm to identify pregnancies in 2013 and to estimate the proportion of women who filled a prescription for an antidepressant from an outpatient pharmacy at various time points in pregnancy. Result(s): We identified 488,887 pregnancies in 2013; 79% resulted in a live birth. A prescription for an antidepressant was filled in 6.2% of pregnancies. Dispensations varied throughout pregnancy and were lowest (3.1%) during the second trimester. Conclusion(s): This work will inform future efforts to estimate medication dispensations during critical periods of preconception, interconception, and pregnancy using health insurance claims data.

AB  - Objective: To prospectively assess women's risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of experiencing post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over 4 years after seeking an abortion, and to assess whether symptoms are attributed to the pregnancy, abortion or birth, or other events in women's lives. Design(s): Prospective longitudinal cohort study which followed women from approximately 1 week after receiving or being denied an abortion (baseline), then every 6 months for 4 years (9 interview waves). Setting(s): 30 abortion facilities located throughout the USA. Participant(s): Among 956 women presenting for abortion care, some of whom received an abortion and some of whom were denied due to advanced gestational age; 863 women are included in the longitudinal analyses. Main Outcome Measure(s): PTSS and PTSD risk were measured using the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD). Index pregnancy-related PTSS was measured by coding the event(s) described by women as the cause of their symptoms. Analyses: We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic mixed-effects regression analyses to assess whether PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS trajectories of women obtaining abortions differed from those who were denied one. Result(s): At baseline, 39% of participants reported any PTSS and 16% reported three or more symptoms. Among women with symptoms 1-week post-abortion seeking (n=338), 30% said their symptoms were due to experiences of sexual, physical or emotional abuse or violence; 20% attributed their symptoms to non-violent relationship issues; and 19% said they were due to the index pregnancy. Baseline levels of PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS outcomes did not differ significantly between women who received and women who were denied an abortion. PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS declined over time for all study groups. Conclusion(s): Women who received an abortion were at no higher risk of PTSD than women denied an abortion.

AB  - Previous research found that women who terminated unwanted pregnancies had higher levels of binge drinking subsequent to termination seeking than those who carried unwanted pregnancies to term. Women who terminated maintained levels of binge drinking after termination, whereas women who gave birth reduced binge drinking and maintained some of this reduction over two and a half years. Neither group surpassed their pre-pregnancy level of binge drinking. This study examines possible moderators of the relationship between terminating an unwanted pregnancy and subsequent binge drinking over 2.5 years. Data are from the Turnaway Study, a prospective, longitudinal study of U.S. women seeking pregnancy termination. Participants presented just before a facility's gestational limit and received terminations (Near Limits, n = 452) or just beyond the limit and were denied terminations (Turnaways, n = 231). Analyses were conducted with mixed effects logistic regression with three way interactions between baseline characteristics, study group, and time. The relationship between termination and subsequent binge drinking was not modified by age, child sex abuse, recent physical violence, history of depression/anxiety, drug use prior to pregnancy recognition, or difficulty deciding to terminate. Parity did modify the relationship between termination and subsequent binge drinking. Among parous women (i.e., women with previous live births), the relationship looked similar to the relationship in previous research. Among nulliparous women, however, the relationship differed, with the reduction in binge drinking among Turnaways less sustained over time and binge drinking among nulliparous Near Limits and Turnaways converging by 2.5 years. While having a baby compared to terminating a pregnancy was associated with a sustained reduction in binge drinking over 2.5 years for parous women, this pattern differed for women who were nulliparous at the time they sought to terminate the pregnancy. Contrary to the hypothesis that the transition to parenting changes subsequent drinking, we found that the transition to parenting for women whose first birth is from an unwanted pregnancy is not associated with a sustained reduction in binge drinking. This suggests that previous research that has found sustained reductions in binge drinking during the transition to parenting may not apply to women who did not want to continue the pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: Prior research has focused primarily on the mental health consequences of abortion; little is known about mental health status before the abortion took place. In this study, the prior psychiatric history of women who have had an abortion is investigated. Method(s): 325 Women who recently had an abortion were compared with 1,902 women from the population-based Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-2). Lifetime prevalence estimates of mood, anxiety, substance use and impulse control disorders were measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Result(s): Lifetime prevalence of any axis-1 mental disorder was significantly higher for the abortion sample (68.3%) than for the reference sample (42.2%). Compared to the reference sample, women in the abortion sample were three times more likely to report a history of any mental disorder (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 2.36-3.98). For all disorder groups and most individual disorders women in the abortion group had significantly higher prevalence estimates and odds ratios ranging from almost 2 to almost 7. The highest odds were found for conduct disorder (OR = 6.97, 95% CI = 4.41-11.01) and drug dependence (OR = 4.96, 95% CI = 2.55-9.66). Similar results were found for lifetime-minus-last-year prevalence estimates and for women who had first-time abortions only. Conclusion(s): The results clearly demonstrate that women who have had an abortion are more likely to have a history of mental disorders than women who have not had an abortion. This could reflect either an increased chance of unintended pregnancy among women with a history of mental disorders compared to controls, or that women with a history of mental health problems more often choose to terminate unintended pregnancies compared to controls, or both. Our results support the notion that psychiatric history may explain associations that have been found between abortion and mental health in previous research. Psychiatric history should therefore be taken into account when investigating the mental health consequences of abortion.

AB  - Background and Objective: Infertility is an individual and a social problem that affects the infertile couple's life and family functioning and may expose them to mental disorders or stress. The aim of this study was to compare the depression and life quality of fertile women and those who suffer from infertility and frequent abortions. Method(s): In this cross sectional study, 30 participants with at least 3 year infertility, 30 participants with at least 2 frequent abortions from medical centers clients and 30 fertile participants who were available in Kerman city, Iran in the first half of the year 2012 were chosen. Data was gathered by using Beck depression and the quality of life questionnaires, the lowest achieved score was 12 for quality of life and 5 for depression and the highest achieved score for quality of life was 48 and for depression was 61. Then gathered data was compared. Finding(s): Depression in women with frequent abortions (36.70+/-14.28) was more than infertile (24.07+/-6.16) and fertile women (15.90+/-11.13). Also life quality of fertile women (34.67+/-7.02) was more than women with frequent abortions (23.03+/-7.53) and infertile women (21.23+/-7.05). There was a significant difference among these groups in two indicators (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The results showed that women suffering from infertility and frequent abortions have higher depression score and lower quality of life score than infertile women.Copyright © 2013, Babol University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - The link between childbearing and severe mental illness is wellestablished, in contrast to the understanding of effects of induced abortion. Evidence on risks associated with childbirth will be described alongside the results of two population based cohort studies using Danish population registers which examined the risk of first-episode and recurrence of mental disorder before and after first trimester induced abortion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore factors associated with suicidal thoughts among women who had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), using data from the New Zealand replication of the WHO Multi-country Violence Against Women study., METHOD: Face-to-face interviews were conducted. A population-based cluster sampling scheme with a fixed number of dwellings per cluster was employed. Logistic regression was conducted to identify those variables independently associated with suicidal ideation., RESULTS: Women who had experienced IPV were more likely to report they had thought about taking their own life if they: reported that their partner's behaviour had impacted on their mental health (OR = 4.81, 95% CI 3.30-7.01); were current or former users of recreational drugs (OR=1.94, 95% CI 1.43-2.64); had experienced a stillbirth/abortion/miscarriage (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.44-2.58); and had experienced emotional abuse in the previous 12 months (OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.96)., CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study corroborates international findings that women's experience of IPV is associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts. While the results point to the need for all health care providers to routinely enquire about intimate partner violence among their patients, they also argue for the need for health care providers to be aware of, and equipped to respond to, the mental health needs of their clients. The results also indicate that there is a need for mental health services to assess for, and respond to intimate partner violence among women presenting with suicidal ideation.

AB  - Introduction: Pregnancy plays a unique role in the transformation of women towards completeness. For those women who have had a previous unsuccessful outcome, pregnancy may bring a lot of inevitable negative emotions. We studied psychiatric morbidity during second trimester of pregnancy subsequent to abortion in the previous pregnancy. Method(s): The study was carried out in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India. A total of 120 patients were divided into 4 groups depending on their pregnancy status. All the groups were compared with each other regarding their psychiatric morbidities, which were measured using various rating scales such as Hamilton Depression rating scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Presumptive Stressful Life events Scale, and Brief Psychotic Rating Scale. Result(s): We found that subjects with history of previous abortion, whether single or more had significantly higher mean depression and anxiety score than primigravida or subjects with history of previous successful pregnancy; depression and anxiety scores decreased with increase in time gap between abortion and current pregnancy. High anxiety was found in 36.67%(11) of females with history of previous abortion. We also found that 36.67%(11) of subjects with previous single abortion and 30%(9) of subjects with previous 2 or more abortions were suffering from depressive episode. None of the female suffered from psychotic disorder. Conclusion(s): The incidence of depression and anxiety is high in pregnancy after previous abortion and more in subjects who conceive earlier after previous abortion. These results warrant the need for screening all pregnancies for psychiatric morbidity after a previous abortion. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impact of prior abortion on anxiety and depression symptoms during a subsequent pregnancy: data from a population-based cohort study in China Objective: The aim of the study was to assess anxiety and depression in women with history of spontaneous abortion or induced abortion during a subsequent pregnancy. Method(s): The data were consecutively obtained from seven maternal and child health (MCH) Centers in the Anhui Province of China. The sociodemographic characteristics of the women, the number of previous pregnancies, number of living children, and gestational age of the current pregnancy were ascertained at the time of the interview. Result(s): The pregnant women who were in the first trimester of their pregnancy reported significantly higher scores than those in the second trimester both on SAS (Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale) and CES-D (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) (SAS score means: 32.11 vs 31.68, P=0.000; CES-D score means: 4.59 vs 4.06, P=0.012). The women with a history of induced abortions were significantly more likely to report more "cases" of depression (OR = 1.543, 95% CI = 1.055- 254) and more "cases" of anxiety (OR = 2.142, 95% CI = 1.294-3.561) during the first trimester than those with no history of abortion. Controlling for confounding variables yielded similar results. However, "cases" of depression and "cases" of anxiety were equally common in women with history of spontaneous abortions and in those with no abortion history. Conclusion(s): These results suggest women who have experienced a previous induced abortion have omnipresent anxiety and depression symptoms during a subsequent pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.

AB  - Background: We know that deliveries are followed by a marked increase in mental disorders, whereas conflicting results have been found for induced abortions. Objective(s): To assess mental disorders in women undergoing induced abortion. Design(s): Historical follow-up study 1995-2007. Material(s) and Method(s): Exposure data were achieved from the National Registry of Patients, and outcomes from the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry. We included all women free of previous psychiatric admissions until nine months before an induced abortion during the period 1995-2007, and assessed the incidence rate of first time in- or outpatient contact with any type of mental disorder from nine months preceding to 12 months after having a first time 1st trimester induced abortion. Result(s): During the study period 82,375 women had a first 1st trimester induced abortion, and the incidence rate of a mental disorder contacts during the nine month before the abortion was 1.40 per 100 exposure years, and 1.55 per 100 exposure years within the first 12 months after the abortion (NS). During the same study period 279,768 women gave birth to their first live-born child and the corresponding rates during pregnancy were 0.38 and after delivery 0.68 first time psychiatric contacts per 100 observation years, respectively. Conclusion(s): While the incidence rate of a first psychiatric contact increases with 79% after as compared with before delivery, we found no significant difference in such contacts after versus before an induced abortion.

AB  - Objective: There has been concern raised regarding the potential harmto women's mental health that might be associated with having aninduced abortion. However, it remains unclear whether inducedabortion is associated with increased risks for psychiatric problemsin contrast to a well documented increased risk of mental disordersafter childbirth. Method(s): We conducted a population-based cohort study whichinvolved linking information from The Danish Civil Registrationsystem to The Danish Psychiatric Central Register and The DanishNational Register of Patients. We included women with no previousrecords of mental disorders during a study period from 1995 to 2007who had a first 1st trimester induced abortion or first childbirth. Weassessed rates of first time psychiatric in- or outpatient contacts forany type of mental disorder in 12 months after abortion or childbirth,as compared with the nine months preceding either event. Result(s): Rate of psychiatric contacts was higher in women whosubsequently had abortions than in women who subsequently gavebirth: Incidence rates per 1000 person years pre and post abortion:14.61 (95% CI: 13.67; 15.62) and 15.22 (95% CI: 14.41; 16.08), andpre and post partum: 3.94 (95% CI; 3.68; 4.23) and 6.69 (95% CI:6.40; 7.00). Risks of psychiatric contacts were unchanged from beforeto after abortion (p=0.19) contrasting risks before and after childbirth(p<0.00001). Conclusion(s): Risks of psychiatric contacts were similar before andafter a 1st trimester abortion contrasting risks before and afterchildbirth. Our results do not indicate an increased risk of mentaldisorders following a first trimester induced abortionThis abstract is under 4th review at New England Journal ofMedicine.

AB  - Recent evidence has linked induced abortion with later adverse psychiatric outcomes in young women. Little is known about later adverse psychiatric outcomes in young men whose partners have fallen pregnant and either go on to have a child, have an abortion or miscarry. 1223 women and 1159 men, from an Austrailan cohort born between 1981 and 1984, were assessed at 21 years for psychiatric and substance misuse and lifetime pregnancy histories. Young women reporting a pregnancy loss (either miscarriage or abortion) had nearly three times the odds of experiencing a illicit drug disorder (excluding cannabis), and nearly twice the odds of an alcohol misuse compared to never pregnant women. Young men whose partner had an abortion, but not a miscarriage, had nearly twice the odds of cannabis disorder, illicit drug disorder, and mood disorder compared to men that had never fathered a pregnancy. Young women who have lost a pregnancy have an increased risk of developing alcohol or substance abuse in later life. Young men whose partner aborted a pregnancy only had an increased of substance abuse and mood disorder in later life. These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that pregnancy loss per se increases the risk of a range of substance use disorders in young women. The findings for young men are novel and raise the possibility that the associations measured may be due to common unmeasured factors associated with early pregnancy in young people rather than pregnancy loss.

AB  - Introduction: Depression stands out as an important health issue that affects the entire family. Objective(s): to assess the prevalence and level of depression and its relationship with autoantibodies, individual, environmental, laboratory and lifestyle parameters in miscarriagepatients Aims: to evaluate the causes or effects of depression in recurrent miscarriage-patients. Method(s): 50 variables containing sociodemographics, health-related habits, depression, serum molecules and blood parameters were evaluated in recurrent miscarriage-patients and healthy women with natural childbirth. Result(s): Although no significant differences for 4 sociodemographic and 18 health-related lifestyle parameters were found between patients and controls but depression score and its prevalence was higher in patients than controls. Depression scores were higher in miscarriage-patients (ranging 3-36, mean=11.92+/-1.37) than controls (ranging 0-8, mean=3.05+/-0.63) which 80.96% of them had no or mild, 2.38% mild-moderate, 4.76% moderate and 11.9% severe depression. There was also a significant association between anti-double-stranded-DNA-antibody (anti-dsDNA) or rheumatoid-factor (RF) level and depression in miscarriage-patients. Interestingly, depression score was inversely correlated with the level of soluble-leptin-receptor (sLeptinR) and soluble-glyeoprotein-130 (sgp130) after controlling for covariates in patients. Depression of miscarriage-patients was correlated with hookah consumption rate. Surprising that, the association between abortion histories and depression in miscarriage-patients become not significant after controlling for age. Conclusion(s): Depression score and its prevalence are higher in miscarriage-patients than controls. The depression levels are correlated with certain autoantibodies such as antidsDNA or some habits like hookah smoking in miscarriage-patients. Inverse association between depression and some soluble molecules like sgp130 or sLeptinR in recurrent miscarriage-patients also remained to be elucidated.

AB  - This study examines the risk of depression, suicidal ideation, and lower self-esteem following an abortion versus a delivery, with and without adjusting for important correlates. Using the National Comorbidity Survey, we tested how first pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery) related to subsequent major depression, suicidal ideation, and self-esteem. Models controlling for risk factors, such as background and economic factors, prepregnancy violence experience, and prepregnancy mental health, as well as a model with all risk factors, were examined. When no risk factors were entered in the model, women who had abortions were more likely to have subsequent depression, OR=1.53, 95% CI [1.05-2.22], and suicidal ideation, OR=2.02, 95% CI [1.40-2.92], but they were not more likely to have lower self-esteem, B=-02. When all risk factors were entered, pregnancy outcome was not significantly related to later depression, OR=0.87, 95% CI [0.54-1.37], and suicidal ideation, OR=1.19, 95% CI [0.70-2.02]. Predictors of mental health following abortion and delivery included prepregnancy depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual violence. Policies and practices implemented in response to the claim that abortion hurts women are not supported by our findings. Efforts to support women's mental health should focus on known risk factors, such as gender-based violence and prior mental health problems, rather than abortion history. © 2011 American Orthopsychiatric Association.

AB  - Objective: To investigate risk factors related with postpartum depression. Material(s) and Method(s): 141 women in 1-24th week of postpartum period who were consulted to Gynecology and Obstetrics clinics for postpartum care and family planning between December 2007-April 2008 included in to the study. A questionnaire to determine the socio-demographic and obstetric features of mothers and Edin burg Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) to assess postpartum depression were performed. Result(s): The rate of postpartum depression was 35.5%. It was seen that postpartum depression was more often among mothers >=25 years of age (p= 0.007). It was determined that absence of a helper to look after the baby 2.2 and unplanned pregnancy 2.4 fold increased the probability of postpartum depression (p= 0.026, p= 0.000, respectively). Having history of depression 5.7 and depression after previous pregnancy 7.5 fold increased the probability of postpartum depression (p= 0.001, p= 0.001, respectively). It was statistically non significant but the probability of postpartum depression was more among the mothers whose monthly income <=500 YTL, who were between 3-6 months after labor, married for <=5 years, had caesarean section, had preterm labor, hospitalized at the last pregnancy, had a sick baby at last pregnancy, smoked during pregnancy, did not breastfeed, had >=3 children, had a history of abortion, still born and voluntary abortion. Conclusion(s): It is thought that it will be useful the widespread use of EPDS in the diagnosis and treatment of pregnant and postpartum women who have risk factors for postpartum depression.

AB  - Background: Antenatal anxiety can adversely affect pregnancy outcome, have an impact on maternal competence in childcare. Lot of emphasis has been given on antenatal depression but studies addressing the anxiety issues are few. Objectives were to study the prevalence of anxiety, using the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) and to identify the risk factors associated with anxiety among antenatal women attending the Anekal Taluk Hospital, Bangalore. Method: This was a cross sectional study, done at Anekal between April and May 2014 among 146 antenatal women by convenience sampling. Results: The mean [SD] age of the study population was 22.52+or-3.04 years. Majority (89.73%) were housewives and 43.2% were in the third trimester of pregnancy. Of the 146 antenatal women, 22.6% of women screened positive for anxiety. Anxiety was significantly associated with primigravida, low parity and previous abortions. Multivariate regression analysis showed significant association of anxiety with period of gestation and gravidity. Conclusion: The findings of the study highlight the importance of routine screening for antenatal anxiety in primary health care.

Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study in a sample of 151 pregnant women in prenatal care. We study variables: socio demographic, gynecological and obstetric, psychological and psychiatric history. Depression was measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, is classified with a cutoff greater than or equal to 13. Tabulated by the software: Excel and Epi-info 2000, V 3.5.3, results are presented in tables and graphs and analyzed with: percentages, mean and standard deviation, Odd Ratio and 95%, Chisquare and p. Results: depression was 19.2%. Average age: 24.78 years (+or-5.35), 57.6% were of lower class, housewives 72.6% and 88.7% lived with their partners, mean gestational age of: 28 (+or--4) and 25% of women with depression had a history of this. Risk factors, tending to the association were: history of previous abortion OR 3.39 (95% CI 1.41 to 8.15), some degree of family dysfunction OR 2.78 (95% CI 1.08 to 7, 1) activity outside the home and 2.92 (95% CI 1.03 to 8.23). Conclusions: Depression in pregnancy was appeared when exist a background of abortion, some degree of family dysfunction and activity outside the home.

AB  - The negative health consequences of tobacco use are well documented. Some research finds women receiving abortions are at increased risk of subsequent tobacco use. This literature has methodological problems, most importantly, inappropriate comparison groups. This study uses data from the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study of women who all sought, but did not all receive, abortions at 30 facilities across the United States. Participants included women presenting just before an abortion facility's gestational age limit who received abortions (Near Limit Abortion Group, n = 452), just after the gestational limit who were denied abortions (Turnaways, n = 231), and who received first trimester abortions (First Trimester Abortion Group, n = 273). This study examined the association between receiving versus being denied an abortion and subsequent tobacco use over 2-years. Trajectories of tobacco use over 2 years were compared using multivariate mixed effects regression. Women receiving abortion maintained their level of tobacco use over 2 years. Women denied abortion initially had lower levels of tobacco use than women receiving abortion, but increased their tobacco use from 1 week through 12-18 months post-abortion seeking and then decreased their use by 2 years post-abortion seeking. Baseline parity modified these associations. Receiving an abortion was not associated with an increase in tobacco use over time. Overall, women who carry unwanted pregnancies to term appear to demonstrate similar cessation and resumption patterns to other pregnant women.

AB  - CONTEXT: Depression affects about 20% of women during their lifetime, with pregnancy being a period of high vulnerability. Prevalence of depression during pregnancy ranges from 4% to 20%. Several risk factors predispose to depression during pregnancy including obstetric factors. Depression during pregnancy is not only the strongest risk factor for post-natal depression but also leads to adverse obstetric outcomes., AIMS: To study the prevalence of depression during pregnancy and its associated obstetric risk factors among pregnant women attending routine antenatal checkup., SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational survey done at the outpatient department (OPD) of the department of obstetrics of a tertiary care hospital in Navi Mumbai., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-five pregnant women were randomly administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for detecting depression. Additional socio-demographic and obstetric history was recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: Prevalence of depression during pregnancy was found to be 9.18% based upon BDI, and it was significantly associated with several obstetric risk factors like gravidity (P = 0.0092), unplanned pregnancy (P = 0.001), history of abortions (P = 0.0001), and a history of obstetric complications, both present (P = 0.0001) and past (P = 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Depression during pregnancy is prevalent among pregnant women in Navi-Mumbai, and several obstetric risk factors were associated to depression during pregnancy. Future research in this area is needed, which will clearly elucidate the potential long-term impact of depression during pregnancy and associated obstetric risk factors so as to help health professionals identify vulnerable groups for early detection, diagnosis, and providing effective interventions for depression during pregnancy.

TI  - Induced abortions and posttraumatic stress - is there any relation? a swedish multi-centre study
AU  - Wallin Lundell, Inger
PY  - 2014
PD  - 
AB  - Introduction: Induced abortion is a common medical intervention. Whether psychological sequelae might follow induced abortion has long been a subject of concern among researchers, and there is lack of knowledge about the relationship between posttraumatic disorder (PTSD) and induced abortion. Aims: To study and compare PTSD, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and anxiety- and depressive symptoms among women seeking abortion, allowing for demographic variables. Further aims were to assess risk factors and to assess PTSD and PTSS following induced abortion in relation to experienced care at the clinic. Methods: This was a multi-centre cohort study targeting women who requested an induced abortion at the outpatient clinics of the gynaecology and obstetrics departments of six public hospitals in Sweden. All women who requested an induced abortion before the end of gestational week 12 were approached for participation. PTSD, PTSS, anxiety- and depressive symptoms, personality traits and women’s perceptions of abortion care were measured by means of questionnaires. Measurements were made at the first visit before the abortion as well as three- and six-months thereafter. Data collection was performed from September 2009 to January 2011. Results: 1,514 women filled out the questionnaire before the abortion. Abortion-seeking women did not suffer from PTSD to a greater extent than the general Swedish female population. Few women (51/720) developed PTSD or PTSS after the abortion, 11 did so due to trauma experience related to the abortion. Women at risk of posttraumatic stress were more likely to be young, having anxiety- or depressive symptoms and personality traits related to neuroticism. Furthermore, women with PTSD or PTSS were more likely to perceive certain aspects of the abortion care as deficient. Conclusions: The vast majority of women coped well with the induced abortion. Few developed posttraumatic stress post abortion. The majority did so because of trauma experiences unrelated to the induced abortion. Young women and women with mental distress are vulnerable groups that need to be paid attention to in abortion care. These women are at risk for negative experiences of the abortion care, and may be at risk of PTSD or PTSS post abortion

TI  - Pregnancy, Caretaking and Substance Use Disorders: A 12-Year Longitudinal Study of Delinquent Females
AU  - Olson, Nichole D.
PY  - 2014
PD  - 
AB  - Delinquent females are at great risk of substance use disorders as they age. It is important to understand factors associated with the persistence and desistence from substance use disorders. The transition to adulthood is particularly important to study. In the general population, emerging adulthood is a period of risk for substance use disorder. This period often also coincides with new social roles, such as caretaking. The current study seeks to address the following aims: (1) to examine the prevalence rates of substance use disorders, pregnancy and caretaking among delinquent females as they age and (2) to describe the association between substance use disorders and periods of pregnancy and caretaking. METHODS: Data are from the Northwestern Juvenile Project (NJP), a longitudinal study of 1,829 (657 females) youth arrested and detained between 1995 and 1998 at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (CCJTDC) in Chicago, Illinois. Participants were interviewed within days of intake and re-interviewed up to 9 times over the following 12 years. Pregnancy and related variables, caretaking and substance use disorders were measured at each interview. Prevalence rates were summarized at 4 time points: baseline (intake to detention), and 3, 5, and 12 years after baseline. Generalized estimating equation modeling was used to examine the association between substance use disorders and pregnancy and caretaking. RESULTS: Most females had been pregnant and one third had an abortion or miscarriage 12 years after baseline. Approximately one quarter gave birth before age 18. More than two thirds were caretakers 12 years after baseline. Substance use disorders were common; nearly half of females had a substance use disorder at baseline and nearly one fifth had a disorder 12 years later. Recent pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of drug, but not alcohol use disorder. Females who were not caretakers were approximately twice as likely to have any substance, alcohol and drug use disorder as caretakers.  DISCUSSION: Pregnancy and caretaking is prevalent among delinquent females. Although many delinquent females may struggle with their role as a mother, pregnancy and caretaking are associated with lower prevalence of substance use disorders.

TI  - Childhood risk factors for the abortion and alcohol use disorders relationship
AU  - Terrell, Heather Kristy
PY  - 2009
PD  - 
AB  - Data from the National Comorbidity Survey, based on women between the ages of 15 to 54, were analyzed in order to better understand the relationships among childhood risk factors, pregnancy termination, and alcohol use disorders. Women whose first pregnancy ended with an induced abortion (274 women) or a live birth (1471 women) were compared to assess the likelihood of developing a subsequent alcohol use disorder (abuse or dependence). Univariate logistic regression analyses and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to determine whether a history of abortion on the first pregnancy was a significant predictor of subsequently meeting the criteria for an alcohol use disorder, after controlling for other factors. These other factors included demographic variables (ethnicity, marital status, religion, income, education level, and age at time of interview), distal risk factors (parent substance abuse, a history of conduct disorder, and pre-existing alcohol misuse symptoms), and proximal risk factors (age of first pregnancy, subsequent abortions, and subsequent live births). Results indicated that the most consistent predictors of the onset of an alcohol use disorder following first pregnancy were a parent history of substance abuse, pre-existing alcohol misuse symptoms, a younger age of first pregnancy and termination of the first pregnancy. These predictors reached significance across all sets of analyses. Although termination of first pregnancy remained a significant predictor of alcohol use disorders over and above the control variables used here, it is likely that other factors that predict the choice to terminate a pregnancy are also associated with an increased likelihood for alcohol use disorders.

AB  - This study was designed to identify predictors of the choice to abort or deliver a child within 18 months of a previous birth and to compare mothers who chose to abort or deliver relative to substance use and adverse partner behavior. Using a systems perspective, data from the Fragile Families and Well-Being Study were examined. The sample included participants from 16 cities, and within the selected cities, hospitals with high rates of unmarried births were chosen for inclusion in the survey. The data analysis process entailed two steps: 1) predictors of the choice to abort were identified statistically; 2) mothers who chose to abort and deliver were compared relative to heavy drinking, cigarette smoking, and adverse partner behavior after controlling for potentially confounding factors identified in step one. The results indicated that several variables pertaining to the father's commitment to raising a previously born child and to his relationship with the mother predicted the choice to abort. Further, a recent abortion was related to substance use and partner perpetrated physical aggression after the effects of confounding variables were removed. Professionals who work with women from impoverished environments facing an unplanned pregnancy should be encouraged to sensitively explore the woman’s support system. If the father is unavailable, counselors can assist women in identifying other sources of support within and outside the family. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Induced abortion in the Republic of Srpska: Characteristics and impact on mental health
AU  - Niškanović, J.
PY  - 2014
PD  - 
AB  - Induced abortion is an important aspect of sexual and reproductive health, with potentially negative impact on physical and emotional health of women. The aim of this paper is to investigate the presence of abortion in our society, characteristics of women who had induced abortion and its impact on mental health. The results presented in this paper are part of the bigger study "Health Status, Health Needs and Utilization of Health Services", which was carried out in Republic of Srpska during 2010. Survey covered 1042 women age from 18 to 49. A standardized set of instruments in the field of sexual-reproductive and mental health (NHS, EUROHIS, ECHIM) was applied. Results indicate that 28.8% of women had induced abortion, while nearly half of them (48.2%) had more than one abortion in their life. Induced abortion is more common among women over 38 years who already have children (97.1%) and live in rural parts of country (61.7%). Abortion is mostly preferred method of birth control among married woman (88.6%), woman with secondary school (64.5%), but is equally present among employed or unemployed woman and housewife's (around 1/3). There was a statistically significant but low correlation between current life satisfaction, mental health and induced abortion (F=8.0, p=0.000; Wilks' lambda =0.97; partial Eta-squared=0.03). More precisely, women who have had abortions have expressed higher levels of stress, lower levels of vitality, and were less satisfied with present life compared to those who did not have an abortion. High rates of induced abortion are present in Balkans countries for a long time (Rašević, 1994: 86; Rašević, 2011: 3). Higher rates of abortion, compared to the European Union and western neighbors, raises the question of presence of "abortion culture" (Rasevic and Sedlecki, 2011: 4). Abortion culture is the consequence of frequent use of traditional method of contraception (coitus interruptus) in combination with low availability of counseling and family planning. Lot of scientific rigorous studies indicate a specific connection between abortion and mental health without supporting attitudes which claim that abortion has a strong impact on mental health (Coleman, 2011: 183), as well as attitudes that deny any effect of abortion on mental health (APA, 2008). The results point the importance of promoting greater sexual-reproductive rights, free and responsible family planning and greater availability of contraceptives as safer methods of birth control.

AB  - Miscarriage and induced abortion are life events that can potentially cause mental distress. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are any differences in the patterns of psychological symptoms after these two events and to point the importance of informed consent.In our study 20 women who experienced miscarriages and 20 women who underwent induced abortions were interviewed in Vilnius out patients clinics. We found that women who had pregnancy termination had more mental distress than women who experienced a miscarriage (guilty, anxiety, anger, episodes of crying etc). Women undergoing abortion had significantly more conflicts in their partnerships. Separation occurred in about one-quarter of all couples. In conclusion women who had undergone an abortion exhibited higher frequency of psychological symptoms than after miscarriage. So we may consider that it is necessary still before induced abortion procedure to inform the couples about an increasing possibility of mental distress.

AU  - Moratalla, NL

PD  - 
AB  - Quantitative epidemiological studies show between high and moderate risk of psychiatric disorders after abortion, especially of addictive behavior and suicidal ideation. Women who had undergone an abortion have experienced 81% increased risk of mental health problems. And about 10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to be attributable to abortion. They are higher and more durable than those which may arise from a spontaneous abortion. Unintended pregnancy causes no trouble and it has not been found that induced abortion causes better outcomes in mental health, so it can not be invoked, on empirical grounds, reasons of mental health of the pregnant woman to induce abortion. Neuroimaging studies have shown that PTSD, which some women suffer after voluntary abortion alter the brain areas that regulate negative emotions and emotional memory. Physicians should transmit the current lack of data regarding the benefits of abortion, while providing information about the risks in mental health carefully statistically validated.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence is common among women having abortions, with between 6% and 22% reporting recent violence from an intimate partner. Concern about violence is a reason some pregnant women decide to terminate their pregnancies. Whether risk of violence decreases after having an abortion, remains unknown.Methods: Data are from the Turnaway Study, a prospective cohort study of women seeking abortions at 30 facilities across the U. S. Participants included women who: presented just prior to a facility's gestational age limit and received abortions (Near Limit Abortion Group, n = 452), presented just beyond the gestational limit and were denied abortions (Turnaways, n = 231), and received first trimester abortions (First Trimester Abortion Group, n = 273). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between receiving versus being denied abortion and subsequent violence from the man involved in the pregnancy over 2.5 years.Results: Physical violence decreased for Near Limits (adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 0.93 per month; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.90, 0.96), but not Turnaways who gave birth (P < .05 versus Near Limits). The decrease for First Trimesters was similar to Near Limits (P = .324). Psychological violence decreased for all groups (aOR, 0.97; CI 0.94, 1.00), with no differential change across groups.Conclusions: Policies restricting abortion provision may result in more women being unable to terminate unwanted pregnancies, potentially keeping them in contact with violent partners, and putting women and their children at risk.

AB  - Background: Examining women's stress and social support following denial and receipt of abortion furthers understanding of the effects of unwanted childbearing and abortion on women's well-being. This study investigated perceived stress and emotional social support over time among women who were denied wanted abortions and who received abortions, and compared outcomes between the groups.Methods: The Turnaway Study is a prospective cohort study of women who sought abortions at 30 abortion facilities across the United States, and follows women via semiannual phone interviews for five years. Participants include 956 English or Spanish speaking women aged 15 and over who sought abortions between 2008 and 2010 and whose gestation in pregnancy fit one of three groups: women who presented up to three weeks beyond a facility's gestational age limit and were denied an abortion; women presenting within two weeks below the limit who received an abortion; and women who received a first trimester abortion. The outcomes were modified versions of the Perceived Stress Scale and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used to assess differences in outcomes between study groups over 30 months.Results: Women denied abortions initially had higher perceived stress than women receiving abortions near gestational age limits (1.0 unit difference on 0-16 scale, P = 0.003). Women receiving first-trimester abortions initially had lower perceived stress than women receiving abortions near gestational age limits (0.6 difference, P = 0.045). By six months, all groups' levels of perceived stress were similar, and levels remained similar through 30 months. Emotional social support scores did not differ among women receiving abortions near gestational limits versus women denied abortions or women having first trimester abortions initially or over time.Conclusions: Soon after being denied abortions, women experienced higher perceived stress than women who received abortions. The study found no longer-term differences in perceived stress or emotional social support between women who received versus were denied abortions.

AU  - Reardon, DC

PY  - 2012
PD  - 
AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in examining death rates associated with different pregnancy outcomes for time periods beyond one year. Previous population studies, however, have failed to control for complete reproductive histories. In this study we seek to eliminate the potential confounding effect of unknown prior pregnancy history by examining mortality rates associated specifically with first pregnancy outcome alone. We also examine differences in mortality rates associated with early abortion and late abortions (after 12 weeks).Material/Method: Medical records for the entire population of women born in Denmark between 1962 and 1991 and were alive in 1980, were linked to death certificates. Mortality rates associated with first pregnancy outcomes (delivery, miscarriage, abortion, and late abortion) were calculated. Odds ratios examining death rates based on reproductive outcomes, adjusted for age at first pregnancy and year of women's births, were also calculated.Results: A total of 463,473 women had their first pregnancy between 1980 and 2004, of whom 2,238 died. In nearly all time periods examined, mortality rates associated with miscarriage or abortion of a first pregnancy were higher than those associated with birth. Compared to women who delivered, the age and birth year adjusted cumulative risk of death for women who had a first trimester abortion was significantly higher in all periods examined, from 180 days (OR=1.84; 1.11 <95% CI <3.71) through 10 years (1.39; 1.22 <95% CI <1.61), as was the risk for women who had abortions after 12 weeks from one year (OR=4.31; 2.18 <95% CI <8.54) through 10 years (OR=2.41; 1.56 <95% CI <2.41). For women who miscarried, the risk was significantly higher for cumulative deaths through 4 years (OR=1.75; 1.34 <95% CI <2.27) and at 10 years (OR=1.48; 1.18 <95% CI <1.85).Conclusions: Compared to women who delivered, women who had an early or late abortion had significantly higher mortality rates within 1 through 10 years. A lesser effect may also be present relative to miscarriage. Recommendations for additional research are offered.

AB  - Background: Research on the links between abortion and mental health has been limited by design problems and relatively weak evidence. Aims: To examine the links between pregnancy outcomes and mental health outcomes. Method: Data were gathered on the pregnancy and mental health history of a birth cohort of over 500 women studied to the age of 30. Results: After adjustment for confounding, abortion was associated with a small increase in the risk of mental disorders; women who had had abortions had rates of mental disorder that were about 30% higher. There were no consistent associations between other pregnancy outcomes and mental health. Estimates of attributable risk indicated that exposure to abortion accounted for 1.5% to 5.5% of the overall rate of mental disorders. Conclusions: The evidence is consistent with the view that abortion may be associated with a small increase in risk of mental disorders. Other pregnancy outcomes were not related to increased risk of mental health problems, Declaration of interest: None. Funding detailed in Acknowledgements. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background: Recent evidence has linked induced abortion with later adverse psychiatric outcomes in young women. Aims: To examine whether abortion or miscarriage are associated with subsequent psychiatric and substance use disorders. Method: A sample (n=1223) of women from a cohort born between 1981 and 1984 in Australia were assessed at 21 years for psychiatric and substance use disorders and life time pregnancy histories. Results: Young women reporting a pregnancy loss had nearly three times the odds of experiencing a lifetime illicit drug disorder (excluding cannabis): abortion odds ratio (OR)=3.6 (95% CI 2.0-6.7) and miscarriage OR=2.6 (95% CI 1.2-5.4). Abortion was associated with alcohol use disorder (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5) and 12-month depression (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Conclusions: These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that pregnancy loss per se, whether abortion or miscarriage, increases the risk of a range of substance use disorders and affective disorders in young women.

TI  - Abortion and depression: A population-based longitudinal study of young women
AU  - Pedersen, Willy
PY  - 2008
PD  - 
AB  - Aim: Induced abortion is an experience shared by a large number of women in Norway, but we know little about the likely social or mental health-related implications of undergoing induced abortion. International studies suggest an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as depression, but many studies are weakened by poor design. One particular problem is the lack of control for confounding factors likely to increase the risk of both abortion and depression. The aim of the study was to investigate whether induced abortion was a risk factor for subsequent depression. Methods: A representative sample of women from the normal population (n=768) was monitored between the ages of 15 and 27 years. Questions covered depression, induced abortion and childbirth, as well as sociodemographic variables, family relationships and a number of individual characteristics, such as schooling and occupational history and conduct problems. Results: Young women who reported having had an abortion in their twenties were more likely to score above the cut-off point for depression (odds ratio (OR) 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0--6.1). Controlling for third variables reduced the association, but it remained significant (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.7--5.6). There was no association between teenage abortion and subsequent depression. Conclusions: Young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Aims To investigate the possible linkages between deliveries, abortions and subsequent nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs from the ages of 15-27years. Methods Data were gathered as part of the Young in Norway Longitudinal Study, an 11-year follow-up of a representative sample of Norwegian adolescents and young adults. Design, setting and participants Information was obtained on (i) the history of childbirths and induced abortions for the participants between the ages of 15-27years; (ii) measures of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs; and (iii) socio-demographic, family and individual confounding factors. Results Those who had had an abortion had elevated rates of substance use and problems. Those who gave birth to a child had reduced rates of alcohol problems and cannabis use. These associations persisted after control for confounders. However, those women who still lived with the father of the aborted fetus were not at increased risk. Conclusions Abortion in women may, under some circumstances, be associated with increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs. The birth of a child may reduce the use of some substances. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, various demographic, psychological, educational, and family variables were explored as predictors of pregnancy resolution. Only 2 of the 17 variables examined were significantly associated with pregnancy resolution (risk-taking and the desire to leave home). After controlling for these variables, adolescents who aborted an unwanted pregnancy were more inclined than adolescents who delivered to seek psychological counseling and they reported more frequent problems sleeping and more frequent marijuana use. No significant differences were observed for cigarette smoking, frequency of alcohol use, and problems with parents based on alcohol use after the controls were instituted; however without controls, significant associations were observed, underscoring the importance of the use of psychological and situational controls in studies of the consequences of abortion. The information derived from this study is potentially useful to parents and professionals who provide guidance to adolescents regarding pregnancy resolution. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background: The extent to which abortion has harmful consequences for mental health remains controversial. We aimed to examine the linkages between having an abortion and mental health outcomes over the interval from age 15-25 years. Methods: Data were gathered as part of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 25-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of New Zealand children. Information was obtained on: a) the history of pregnancy/abortion for female participants over the interval from 15-25 years; b) measures of DSM-IV mental disorders and suicidal behaviour over the intervals 15-18, 18-21 and 21-25 years; and c) childhood, family and related confounding factors. Results: Forty-one percent of women had become pregnant on at least one occasion prior to age 25, with 14.6% having an abortion. Those having an abortion had elevated rates of subsequent mental health problems including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviours and substance use disorders. This association persisted after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions: The findings suggest that abortion in young women may be associated with increased risks of mental health problems.

AB  - Objective: To examine the outcomes of an unwanted first pregnancy (abortion v live delivery) and risk of depression and to explain discrepancies with previous research that used the same dataset. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Nationally representative sample of US men and women aged 14-24 in 1979. Participants: 1247 women in the US national longitudinal survey of youth who aborted or delivered an unwanted first pregnancy. Main outcome measures: Clinical cut-off and continuous scores on a 1992 measure of the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale. Results: Terminating compared with delivering an unwanted first pregnancy was not directly related to risk of clinically significant depression (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.66). No evidence was found of a relation between pregnancy outcome and depression in analyses of subgroups known to vary in under-reporting of abortion. In analyses of the characteristics of non-respondents, refusal to provide information on abortion did not explain the lack of detecting a relation between abortion and mental health. The abortion group had a significantly higher mean education and income and lower total family size, all of which were associated with a lower risk of depression. Conclusions: Evidence that choosing to terminate rather than deliver an unwanted first pregnancy puts women at higher risk of depression is inconclusive. Discrepancies between current findings and those of previous research using the same dataset primarily reflect differences in coding of a first pregnancy. 3 Tables, 5 References. P. Broxis

AB  - Objective. The primary objectives of this study were to explore maternal history of perinatal loss and pregnancy wantedness as correlates of substance use during pregnancy. Method. The research design involved interviewing women who gave birth in Washington DC hospitals during 1992. Interview data included pregnancy history (prior births, induced abortions, miscarriages, and stillbirths), desire for the pregnancy (wanted, not wanted, mistimed), socio-demographic information, timing of onset of prenatal care, and substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs) during pregnancy. Results. A history of induced abortion was associated with elevated risk for maternal substance use of various forms; whereas other forms of perinatal loss (miscarriage and stillbirth) were not related to substance use. Unwanted pregnancy was associated with cigarette smoking during pregnancy, but not with any other forms of substance use. Conclusions. Reproductive history information may offer insight to professionals pertaining to the likelihood of women using substances in a later pregnancy. (Original abstract)

AB  - Abortion is known to be associated with higher rates of substance abuse, but no studies have compared substance use rates associated with abortion compared to delivery of an unintended pregnancy. This study examines data for women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth whose first pregnancy was unintended. Women with no pregnancies were also used as a control group. Use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and behaviors suggestive of alcohol abuse were examined an average of four years after the target pregnancy among women with prior histories of delivering an unintended pregnancy (n = 535), abortion (n = 213), or those who reported no pregnancies (n = 1144). Controls were instituted for age, race, marital status, income, education, and prepregnancy self-esteem and locus of control. Compared to women who carried an unintended first pregnancy to term, those who aborted were significantly more likely to report use of marijuana (odds ratio: 2.0), with the difference in these two groups approaching significance relative to the use of cocaine (odds ratio: 2.49). Women with a history of abortion also reported more frequent drinking than those with a history of unintended birth. With the exception of less frequent drinking, the unintended birth group was not significantly different from the no pregnancy group. Resolution of an unintended pregnancy by abortion was associated with significantly higher rates of subsequent substance use compared to delivering an unintended pregnancy. A history of abortion may be a useful marker for identifying women in need of counseling for substance use. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the psychological trauma reactions of women who had either a miscarriage or an induced abortion, in the 2 years after the event. Further, to identify important predictors of Impact of Event Scale (IES) scores.  METHOD: A consecutive sample of women who experienced miscarriage (N = 40) or induced abortion (N = 80) were interviewed 3 times: 10 days (T1), 6 months (T2), and 2 years (T3) after the event.  RESULTS: At T1, 47.5% of the women who had a miscarriage were cases (IES score 19 points on 1 or both of the IES subscales), compared with 30% for women who had an induced abortion (p = .60). The corresponding values at T3 were 2.6% and 18.1%, respectively (p = .019). At all measurement time points, the group who had induced abortion scored higher on IES avoidance. Women who had a miscarriage were more likely to experience feelings of loss and grief, whereas women who had induced abortion were more likely to experience feelings of relief, guilt, and shame. At T3, IES intrusion was predicted by feelings of loss and grief at T1, whereas avoidance at T3 was predicted by guilt and shame at T1.  CONCLUSION: The short-term emotional reactions to miscarriage appear to be larger and more powerful than those to induced abortion. In the long term, however, women who had induced abortion reported significantly more avoidance of thoughts and feelings related to the event than women who had a miscarriage. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Coren presents the findings of the study entitled "Quality of life following early medical or surgical abortion" by Westhoff et al. In a prospective cohort study of 97 patients, all examined aspects of quality of life improved significantly within one month after abortion. The authors note, however, that their study is limited by its nonrandomized design, and that because it is conducted in a private office setting, they acknowledge that the results may not be generalizable to the majority of abortion seekers in the US who undergo the procedure in freestanding clinics.

PY  - 2002
PD  - 
AB  - Background: Studies suggest that experiencing a perinatal loss may leave women vulnerable to mental health problems and may compromise parenting. Unfortunately, compared to miscarriages and stillbirths, very little research has examined the potential for grief and feelings of loss associated with elective abortion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the quality of the childcare environment and children's development among children of mothers with a history of abortion prior to childbirth (n = 672) and children of non post-abortive women (n = 4,172). Method: Data were derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), with comparisons based on two assessments of the caregiving environment and scores on four child outcome variables. The sample was divided into three child age categories: 1-4 years (n = 1,502), 5-9 years (n = 2,121), and 10-13 years (n = 1,524). Results: After controlling for numerous potentially confounding socio-demographic variables, lower scores were observed for the post-abortion group relative to the level of emotional support in the home among first-born children in the youngest age category. Further, among 5-9-year-olds, more behavior problems were revealed for the children of women with a history of abortion. Finally, no main effects were detected between the abortion history groups relative to the level of cognitive stimulation in the home. Conclusion: Although it is widely recognized that at least 10% of post-abortive women experience negative psychological consequences, the potential effects of negative subjective experiences on parenting need more systematic attention.

AB  - Using data from the United States National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) and the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), we conducted secondary data analyses to examine the relationship of abortion, including multiple abortions, to anxiety after first pregnancy outcome in two studies. First, when analyzing the NSFG, we found that pre-pregnancy anxiety symptoms, rape history, age at first pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery), race, marital status, income, education, subsequent abortions, and subsequent deliveries accounted for a significant association initially found between first pregnancy outcome and experiencing subsequent anxiety symptoms. We then tested the relationship of abortion to clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder, using NCS data. Contrary to findings from our analyses of the NSFG, in the NCS analyses we did not find a significant relationship between first pregnancy outcome and subsequent rates of GAD, social anxiety, or PTSD. However, multiple abortions were found to be associated with much higher rates of PTSD and social anxiety; this relationship was largely explained by pre-pregnancy mental health disorders and their association with higher rates of violence. Researchers and clinicians need to learn more about the relations of violence exposure, mental health, and pregnancy outcome to avoid attributing poor mental health solely to pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824 women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not significant after the third year.

AB  - Background: Termination of pregnancy is a common and safe medical procedure in countries where it is legal. One in four Australian women terminates a pregnancy, most often when young. There is inconclusive evidence about whether pregnancy termination affects women's rates of depression. There is evidence of a strong association between partner violence and depression. Our objective was to examine the associations with depression of women's experience of violence, pregnancy termination, births and socio-demographic characteristics, among a population-based sample of young Australian women.Methods: The data from the Younger cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health comprised 14,776 women aged 18-23 in Survey I (1996) of whom 9683 aged 22-27 also responded to Survey 2 (2000). With linked data, we distinguished terminations, violence and depression reported before and after 1996.We used logistic regression to examine the association of depression (CES-D 10) as both a dichotomous and linear measure in 2000 with pregnancy termination, numbers of births and with violence separately and then in mutually adjusted models with sociodemographic variables.Results: 30% of young women were depressed. Eleven percent (n = 1076) reported a termination by 2000. A first termination before 1996 and between 1996 and 2000 were both associated with depression in a univariate model (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.12 to 1.66; OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.24 to 1.87). However, after adjustment for violence, numbers of births and sociodemographic variables (OR 1.22, 95%CI 0.99 to 1.51) this became only marginally significant, a similar association with having two or more births (1.26, 95%CI. 1.00 to 1.58). In contrast, any form of violence but especially that of partner violence in 1996 or 2000, was significantly associated with depression: in univariate (OR 2.31, 95%CI 1.97 to 2.70 or 2.45, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.04) and multivariate models (AOR 2.06, 95%CI 1.74 to 2.43 or 2.12, 95%CI 1.69 to 2.65). Linear regression showed a four fold greater effect of violence than termination or births.Conclusion: Violence, especially partner violence, makes a significantly greater contribution to women's depression compared with pregnancy termination or births. Any strategy to reduce the burden of women's depression should include prevention or reduction of violence against women and strengthening women's sexual and reproductive health to ensure that pregnancies are planned and wanted.

TI  - The relationship between abortion and depression: New evidence from the fragile families and child wellbeing study
AU  - Rees D.I.
AU  - Sabia J.J.
PY  - 2007
PD  - 
AB  - Background: Although a number of studies have used survey data to examine the relationship between abortion and depression, none adjusted their estimates for pre-pregnancy depression. The purpose of this study was to test if abortion is associated with a different risk of major depression (MD) symptomatology than other pregnancy outcomes after adjusting for prior depression. Material/Methods: The current study used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a representative sample of women living in large US cities who recently gave birth. Particpants were administered the Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form (CIDI-SF) during the first and second follow-up interviews. Changes in depressive symptoms from the first to the second follow-up interviews were related to abortion and other pregnancy outcomes including giving birth and miscarriage. Result(s): Women who had an abortion between the first and second follow-up interviews were almost twice as likely to have symptoms of MD as women who did not become pregnant. This difference could not be explained by factors such as race, ethnicity, age, education, household income, number of children, or prior depressive symptomatology. In fact, after adjusting for these factors, abortion was still associated with a more than two-fold increase in the likelihood of having depressive symptoms at second follow-up (OR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.01 to 4.57, p=0.047). Giving birth was associated with a statistically comparable increase in the likelihood of having the symptoms of MD. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that the positive association between abortion and depressive symptoms cannot be explained by pre-pregnancy depression. Women who have an abortion are not at higher risk of MD than those who give birth. © Med Sci Monit, 2007.

AB  - Objectives: To understand perinatal depression, identify risk factors for depression during pregnancy, recognize depression during pregnancy, describe the possible links between depression and pregnancy, discover whether this disease affects the newborn, pregnancy or childbirth, and analyze treatment for depression during pregnancy. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed an observational, descriptive, prospective study of 118 pregnant women followed-up in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Psychosomatic Unit of the Maternity Hospital of Malaga for anxiety, depression or psychopharmacological treatment. Result(s): A history of depression was found in 30% of the patients and a history of anxiety disorder in 9%. Among the patients treated, 63 had depression, 106 had anxiety (56 with depression), and nine had stress (five with anxiety and four with anxiety and depression). Sixty percent had one previous delivery and 40% had had one or more abortions (32% were voluntary). Pregnancy terminated in vaginal delivery in 66%, cesarean section in 28%, miscarriage in 4%, abortion in 2%, and preterm delivery in 16% (a frequency higher than in the general population, corroborating the literature on the subject). Of preterm deliveries, 5% were vaginal deliveries and 11% were cesarean sections. Treatment for depression consisted of antidepressant drugs in 63% (51% with paroxetine, 9% with fluoxetine and 3% with sertraline). Among patients treated for anxiety, 91% received an anxiolytic agent during the pregnancy. Only 11% rejected their newborns: 31% due to preterm delivery, 31% due to maternal depression, 15% due to severe cardiac defects, 7.5% due to the death of the husband, 7.5% due to death of the second twin, and 7.5% due to major problems with the partner. Conclusion(s): The factors associated with a greater risk of anxiety or depression in pregnancy were as follows: age more than 30 years old, being a secundipara and having a prior abortion, a history of depression, difficulties in the relationship with the partner, being a housewife or working in the catering trade or hotel industry, undergoing an invasive technique during pregnancy, and hospital stay due to hyperemesis. The effects of anxiety and depression are more negative for the fetus than those of drug treatment for these disorders.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 10-20% of women within 4-6 weeks following delivery. In order to obtain an early diagnosis, tools such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory (PDPI) have been constructed. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to identify PPD risk factors. Material(s) and Method(s): The 348 women who made up the initial sample gave birth in the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Unit of the "San Martino" Hospital, Genoa. A first evaluation with EDPS and PDPI tests took place 48 hours after delivery and a second evaluation one month after delivery with EPDS. The data collected after 48 hours were compared with the 1-month EPDS score. In addition, the 48-hour EPDS and the 1-month EPDS scores were also compared. Result(s): From the socio-demographic standpoint, the sample was homogeneous. Depression during pregnancy and a history of abortion proved to be correlated with a 1-month EPDS score >=10. Conclusion(s): Depression during pregnancy and a history of abortion are the factors most strongly associated with a high risk of developing PPD. No statistically significant correlation was found between EPDS scores recorded at 48 hours and those recorded 1 month after delivery.

AB  - Objective. To compare medical consumption in general practice between women who underwent an induced abortion and women who did not. Design. Historical cohort study. Method. We selected 190 women who underwent an induced abortion in the period 1975-2004 and 145 control patients. Women were selected from the Continuous Morbidity Registration from the University Medical Centre St Radboud in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Patient records were reviewed to assess socioeconomic background variables and medical consumption in the 3 years before and 3 years after the abortion. Patients were divided into 3 cohorts, based on time period. Results. Patients who underwent an abortion had no increase in medical consumption in general practice after the abortion, compared with before the abortion. They also had no increase in visits to the general practitioner with psychosocial or psychiatric problems after the procedure, nor were they prescribed more medication. Compared with the control group, however, women who elected to have an induced abortion had increased medical consumption and more psychosocial consultations before and after the procedure. During the study period, medical consumption and the number of psychosocial and psychiatric consultations increased in women who had an induced abortion but decreased in those who did not. Conclusion. Women who underwent induced abortion had greater medical consumption and more psychosocial problems than those who did not. However, medical consumption and the prevalence of psychosocial problems were similar before and after the procedure. Therefore, induced abortion did not lead to increased medical consumption.

AB  - Background. The aims of the study were to assess anxiety and depression in women who had experienced either a miscarriage or an induced abortion, to compare the women's level of distress with that of a general population sample, and to find predictors of anxiety and depression six months and five years after the event. Methods. A prospective, longitudinal follow-up study. Women who experienced miscarriage ( n =40) and induced abortion ( n =80) were interviewed ten days (T1), six months (T2), two years (T3), and five years (T4) after the event. On each occasion, they completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Life Events Scale. Paired-sample t -test, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression statistical tests were used. Results. Women with miscarriage had significantly more anxiety and depression at T1 than the general population, while women with induced abortion had significantly more anxiety at all time points and more depression at T1 and T2. In both groups, important predictors of anxiety and depression at T2 and T4 were recent life events and poor former psychiatric health. Childbirth events between T1 and T4 had no significant influence on the scores. For women with induced abortion, doubt about the decision to abort was related to depression at T2 (p <0.05), while a negative attitude towards induced abortion was associated with anxiety at T2 (p <0.05) and T4 (p <0.05). Conclusion. Correlates of anxiety and depression may be used to better identify women who are at risk of negative psychological responses following pregnancy termination. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Miscarriage and induced abortion are life events that can potentially cause mental distress. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the patterns of normalization of mental health scores after these two pregnancy termination events. Method(s): Forty women who experienced miscarriages and 80 women who underwent abortions at the main hospital of Buskerud County in Norway were interviewed. All subjects completed the following questionnaires 10 days (T1), six months (T2), two years (T3) and five years (T4) after the pregnancy termination: Impact of Event Scale (IES), Quality of Life, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and another addressing their feelings about the pregnancy termination. Differential changes in mean scores were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and inter-group differences were assessed by ordinary least squares methods. Result(s): Women who had experienced a miscarriage had more mental distress at 10 days and six months after the pregnancy termination than women who had undergone an abortion. However, women who had had a miscarriage exhibited significantly quicker improvement on IES scores for avoidance, grief, loss, guilt and anger throughout the observation period. Women who experienced induced abortion had significantly greater IES scores for avoidance and for the feelings of guilt, shame and relief than the miscarriage group at two and five years after the pregnancy termination (IES avoidance means: 3.2 vs 9.3 at T3, respectively, p < 0.001; 1.5 vs 8.3 at T4, respectively, p < 0.001). Compared with the general population, women who had undergone induced abortion had significantly higher HADS anxiety scores at all four interviews (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), while women who had had a miscarriage had significantly higher anxiety scores only at T1 (p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): The course of psychological responses to miscarriage and abortion differed during the five-year period after the event. Women who had undergone an abortion exhibited higher scores during the follow-up period for some outcomes. The difference in the courses of responses may partly result from the different characteristics of the two, pregnancy termination events. © 2005 Broen et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The psychological consequences of induced abortion are complex and subject to both considerable controversy and methodological criticisms. While many women report feelings of relief immediately after the procedure, others report feelings of anxiety, which they attribute to their abortions. The purpose of the present study was to examine risk of generalized anxiety following unintended pregnancies ending in abortion or childbirth using a large representative sample of American women. Among all women, those who aborted were found to have significantly higher rates of subsequent generalized anxiety when controlling for race and age at interview. Implications of the findings are discussed. In particular, findings highlight the clinical relevance of exploring reproductive history in therapeutic efforts to assist women seeking relief from anxiety. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Other than premenstrual dysphoria, few studies have examined the extent to which basic characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence of other reproductive landmarks impact on the risk of major depression. Method(s): From a population-based sample of 4161 premenopausal women 36-45 years of age, we identified 332 women who met DSM criteria for past or current major depression and a sample of 644 women with no such history. In person interviews included a detailed assessment of menstrual cycle characteristics from age at menarche through study enrollment as well as other reproductive landmarks. Result(s): Risk of depression increased significantly with decreasing age at menarche (P<0.001). The risk of depression was also higher in women with heavier menstrual flow and cycle irregularity during the first 5 years of menstruation. Women with a history of multiple abortions were 2-3-times more likely to develop major depression (95% CI 1.6-4.1). Increasing months of breastfeeding was associated with a decreased risk of depression after adjustment for education, marital status, and number of livebirths (P-value, test of trend=0.012). This association was largely confined to depression during the postpartum period. Limitation(s): Menstrual and pregnancy history exposures were self-reported and retrospectively assessed. However, women with and without a HISTORY of depression were subject to similar recall requirements that likely resulted in an underestimate of most risk estimates. Conclusion(s): Clinicians involved in routine obstetrical and gynecological care of women need to recognize that menstrual and pregnancy history events may serve as potential markers for subsequent psychiatric sequelae. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Individual and situational risk factors associated with negative postabortion psychological sequelae have been identified, but the degree of posttraumatic stress reactions and the effects of culture are largely unknown. Material/Methods: Retrospective data were collected using the Institute for Pregnancy Loss Questionnaire (IPLQ) and the Traumatic Stress Institute's (TSI) Belief Scale administered at health care facilities to 548 women (331 Russian and 217 American) who had experienced one or more abortions, but no other pregnancy losses. Result(s): Overall, the findings here indicated that American women were more negatively influenced by their abortion experiences than Russian women. While 65% of American women and 13.1% of Russian women experienced multiple symptoms of increased arousal, re-experiencing and avoidance associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 14.3% of American and 0.9% of Russian women met the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Russian women had significantly higher scores on the TSI Belief Scale than American women, indicating more disruption of cognitive schemas. In this sample, American women were considerably more likely to have experienced childhood and adult traumatic experiences than Russian women. Predictors of positive and -negative outcomes associated with abortion differed across the two cultures. Conclusion(s): Posttraumatic stress reactions were found to be associated with abortion. Consistent with previous research, the data here suggest abortion can increase stress and decrease coping abilities, particularly for those women who have a history of adverse childhood events and prior traumata. Study limitations preclude drawing definitive conclusions, but the findings do suggest additional cross-cultural research is warranted.

AB  - Background: Existing research pertaining to emotional reactions to abortion is limited by (a) short follow up periods, (b) the absence of information on prior psychological state, and (c) lack of nationally representative samples. Therefore the purpose of this study was to compare women with a history of abortion vs. delivery relative to depression using a nationally representative longitudinal design, which enabled inclusion of a control for prior psychological state. Material/Methods: The current study employed data for all women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) who experienced their first pregnancy event (abortion or childbirth) between 1980 and 1992 (n = 1,884). Depression scores in 1992, an average of 8 years after the subjects' first pregnancy events, were compared after controlling for age, race, marital status, divorce history, education, income, and external locus of control scores. The latter was used to control for pre-pregnancy psychological state. Results were also examined separately for groups based on race, marital status, and divorce history. Result(s): After controlling for several socio-demographic factors, women whose first pregnancies ended in abortion were 65% more likely to score in the 'high-risk' range for clinical depression than women whose first pregnancies resulted in a birth. Differences were greatest among the demographic groups most likely to report an abortion. Conclusion(s): Abortion may be a risk factor for subsequent depression in the period of 8 years after the pregnancy event. The higher rates of depression identified may be due to delayed reactions, persistence of depression, or some other common risk factor.

AB  - Background. A national study in Finland showed significantly higher death rates associated with abortion than with childbirth. Our objective was to examine this association using an American population over a longer period. Methods. California Medicaid records for 173,279 women who had an induced abortion or a delivery in 1989 were linked to death certificates for 1989 to 1997. Results. Compared with women who delivered, those who aborted had a significantly higher age-adjusted risk of death from all causes (1.62), from suicide (2.54), and from accidents (1.82), as well as a higher relative risk of death from natural causes (1.44), including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2.18), circulatory diseases (2.87), and cerebrovascular disease (5.46). Results are stratified by age and time. Conclusions. Higher death rates associated with abortion persist over time and across socioeconomic boundaries. This may be explained by self-destructive tendencies, depression, and other unhealthy behavior aggravated by the abortion experience.

AB  - Background: Studies suggest that experiencing a perinatal loss may leave women vulnerable to mental health problems and may compromise parenting. Unfortunately, compared to miscarriages and stillbirths, very little research has examined the potential for grief and feelings of loss associated with elective abortion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the quality of the childcare environment and children's development among children of mothers with a history of abortion prior to childbirth (n = 672) and children of non post-abortive women (n = 4,172). Method(s): Data were derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), with comparisons based on two assessments of the caregiving environment and scores on four child outcome variables. The sample was divided into three child age categories: 1-4 years (n = 1,502), 5-9 years (n = 2,121), and 10-13 years (n = 1,524). Result(s): After controlling for numerous potentially confounding socio-demographic variables, lower scores were observed for the post-abortion group relative to the level of emotional support in the home among first-born children in the youngest age category. Further, among 5-9-year-olds, more behavior problems were revealed for the children of women with a history of abortion. Finally, no main effects were detected between the abortion history groups relative to the level of cognitive stimulation in the home. Conclusion(s): Although it is widely recognized that at least 10% of post-abortive women experience negative psychological consequences, the potential effects of negative subjective experiences on parenting need more systematic attention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has revealed a general association between induced abortion and substance use. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation when substance use is measured specifically during a subsequent pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A nationally representative sample of women was surveyed about substance use during pregnancy shortly after giving birth. Women with a previous induced abortion, whose second pregnancy was delivered, were compared separately with women with one previous birth and with women with no previous births. RESULT(S): Compared with women who gave birth, women who had had an induced abortion were significantly more likely to use marijuana (odds ratio, 10.29; 95% Cl, 3.47-30.56), various illicit drugs (odds ratio, 5.60; 95% Cl, 2.39-13.10), and alcohol (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% Cl, 1.31-3.76) during their next pregnancy. The results with only first-time mothers were very similar. CONCLUSION(S): Psychosocial mechanisms that may explain the findings are discussed. Screening for abortion history may help to identify pregnant women who are at risk for substance use more effectively.

AB  - Background: Recent studies have shown that depression during pregnancy is even more common than post-partum depression. Given the serious effects of depression during pregnancy, the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of depression and its related factors in pregnant women admitted to two teaching hospitals. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we studied 400 pregnant women who were referred to Prenatal Clinics of Baqiyatallah and Najmieh Hospitals over a 2.5 month period. The instrument for the evaluation of depression was Beck Depression Inventory. Findings: The frequency of depression was 21.3% (85 cases). Depression was associated with low maternal age (p=0.008), number of gestations (p=0.001), gestational age (p=0.018), number of other children (p=0.001), history of depression (p=0.001) and history of abortion (p=0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that only low maternal age (under 25 years), history of depression and history of abortion were risk factors of depression. Conclusion: Due to the high frequency of depression in pregnant women, screening of depression is necessary during this period.

AB  - To investigate the possible linkages between deliveries, abortions and subsequent nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs from the ages of 15-27 years. Data were gathered as part of the Young in Norway Longitudinal Study, an 11-year follow-up of a representative sample of Norwegian adolescents and young adults. Information was obtained on (i) the history of childbirths and induced abortions for the participants between the ages of 15-27 years; (ii) measures of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs; and (iii) socio-demographic, family and individual confounding factors. Those who had had an abortion had elevated rates of substance use and problems. Those who gave birth to a child had reduced rates of alcohol problems and cannabis use. These associations persisted after control for confounders. However, those women who still lived with the father of the aborted fetus were not at increased risk. Abortion in women may, under some circumstances, be associated with increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol problems and use of cannabis and other illegal drugs. The birth of a child may reduce the use of some substances. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - The relationship between abortion and depression: Evidence from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
AU  - Warren, Jocelyn T.

PD  - 
AB  - A majority of states require parental consent or notification before a minor may have an abortion. Parental involvement laws are based in part on the assumption that abortion poses a risk to the psychological health of adolescents. Previous research has catalogued the risks to adolescent mothers and their children posed by early childbearing, the alternative to abortion. The health risks of delaying abortion also have been documented. Few studies, however, have attempted to quantify the risks of abortion to adolescents’ mental health. Research suggests that associations between abortion and depression demonstrated in some studies of adult women may be spurious and reflect unmeasured covariates, such as intendedness of the pregnancy. This study used secondary data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to test whether having an abortion put adolescent women at risk for developing depression in the short term and over time. Respondents were interviewed three times, in 1994-1995 (Wave I), 1996 (Wave II), and in 2001 (Wave III). Logistic regression was used to test whether adolescents who had an abortion between Waves I and II had an increased risk for developing depression. Adolescents who had an abortion were compared with adolescents who also became pregnant but did not have an abortion and with the larger sample of female adolescents. Abortion was not associated with developing depression, either in the short term or over time. Unintended pregnancy between Waves I and II also was not significant in predicting depression. Prior pregnancy (before Wave I), however, did predict depression five years later. Thus, this study found no evidence to support legal restrictions on abortion for minors on the basis of increased risk of depression. However, findings do suggest that pregnancy in early adolescence may be a risk factor for developing depression in young adulthood. The relationship between adolescent pregnancy and later depression underscores the need for effective pregnancy prevention programs in early adolescence.

AU  - Keefe-Cooperman, Kathleen Lee

AB  - This dissertation compared maternal bereavement between women who experienced miscarriage and women who terminated a wanted pregnancy due to fetal abnormality. The first hypothesis was that females who terminated a wanted pregnancy would experience a greater vulnerability for grief complications as evidenced by a depressive reaction. The second hypothesis was that the greater the number of contributing variables, the higher the degree of complicated grief in both sample groups as reflected by the scores on the grief measurement scales. Grief was assessed using the Perinatal Grief Scale-Shortened (PGS-S), the Perinatal Bereavement Scale (PBS), and the Perinatal Loss Experience and Needs Assessment Questionnaire (PLENAQ). Ninety-five questionnaires were returned from a female population gathered through clinician recruitment, a local support group, the world wide web, and perinatal newsletters. The two groups were found to be significantly different in the areas of age, time married, total family income, and number of losses. There was no significant correlation between the miscarriage group and termination group as related to the PGS-S or PBS total scores. Six fixed variables were found to relate to PBS and PGS-S scores: time since the most recent loss; the intervention of counseling; employment outside the home; feeling responsible for the perinatal loss; age of the mother as related to guilt; and the gestational length of pregnancy. Time was the only variable found to significantly interact with other fixed independent variables in relation to the dependent PBS and PGS-S scores. The study findings were used in the development of a screening questionnaire for perinatal bereavement, and model for a time limited perinatal bereavement group.

AB  - Previous research indicates that abortion increases risk for experiencing difficulties maintaining committed relationships, sexual dysfunction, and psychological problems. In the present descriptive study, associations between abortion and attitudes and behaviors associated with casual sexual activity were examined after controlling for family of origin, socio-demographic, reproductive history, and sexual history variables. The National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), a multistage probability sample of 3,432 men and women between the ages of 18 and 59 was the data source. Among women, abortion was associated with more positive attitudes toward sex with strangers and with being forced to have sex; whereas the male experience of a partner abortion was correlated with attitudes endorsing sex with more than one partner and with strangers. Abortion among men and women predicted disagreement relative to restricting sexual activity to love relations, more sex partners in the last year, and endorsement for having sex with an acquaintance. Male experience of a partner abortion also increased the likelihood of having sex with a friend. Finally, abortion predicted engagement in various impersonal sexual behaviors over the previous 12 months among males and females. Strengths of the study include the large nationally representative data source and employment of a variety of control variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of the study was to verify the following hypotheses: 1) Elective abortion correlates with emotional and psychosexual immaturity attributable to a core symbiotic dynamic, whereas childbirth correlates with a higher level of maturity attributable to sounder integration of the separation-individuation process. 2) Relative to each other, the family models and parental images of women who undergo elective abortion are significantly more permissive, whereas those of women who carry their pregnancies to term are significantly more structuring. 3) To the extent that women who undergo elective abortion do show relative psychosexually immaturity in the senses hypothesized above, their acts of elective abortion constitute 'acting out' within the scope of narcissistic conflict. On the contrary, and to the extent they are related to psychosexual maturity, acts of childbirth are narcissistically creative acts attesting to a capacity for effective symbolization.

N1  - Julia Littell (2024-07-19 20:48:45)(Screen): from the doi: "This article, a synthesis of a Doctoral Thesis, compares, through a psychometric evaluation (clinical interview, MMPI and Rorschach), the psychodynamic functioning of two groups of women between 18 and 22 years of age, belonging to the normal population, that is, without significant associated pathology. One of the groups consists of women who decided to voluntarily terminate their pregnancy and the other of women who carried it to term.

The study was based on three hypotheses about the nature of the desire to have a child in relation to parental ties. The first was based on the idea that psychosexual and emotional maturity was greater in young mothers than in those who decided to have an abortion. The second hypothesis considered that this relative psychoaffective and psychosexual immaturity could be based on great parental permissiveness, while a stricter upbringing in young mothers would have favoured the establishment of the identification ties necessary to complete a pregnancy. The third hypothesis predicted a personality structure and functioning in psychometric tests within normal limits for both groups, but also a more efficient capacity for symbolisation in young mothers than in those who had had an abortion. Abortion would therefore be the equivalent of “acting out” related to the lack of capacity for symbolisation.

The contrast of these hypotheses was based on an experimental and statistical methodology rigorously applied to the two samples. The psychometric tests administered to each subject allowed the clinical verification of each of the stated hypotheses. In order to obtain statistical values, the clinical data were analyzed using non-parametric tests valid for two equal samples.

Although both groups were clinically normal, the degree of psycho-affective and psychosexual maturity was greater in the young mothers than in the other group. The cause of this affective “immaturity” could be linked to failures in the process of individuation-separation due to a partial fixation in the mirror stage (Lacan) which would block the access of young women with abortions to the depressive position (Klein), while such access would be easier for young mothers.

It was also observed that this partial fixation in the mirror stage in young women with abortions could depend on a lack of parental symbolic representations (especially paternal), which would facilitate identification with an archaic and all-powerful mother, within a family model that is too permissive. On the contrary, in young mothers, the achievement of an identification with a differentiated mother would be based on more stable parental symbolic representations, consistent with a more structuring family organization.

In this way, fixation on the mirror stage would turn abortion into the equivalent of “acting out,” due to the failure of the symbolic internalization of a differentiated mother, blocking access to the depressive position.

In the light of these clinical findings, the fixation on the mirror stage seems to require work that favours the subject's maturation, in order to prevent the repetition of successive abortions and the risk of the woman slipping into psychopathological territory. In the same clinical framework, this work opens new avenues for the study of some conditions related to the desire to give birth, such as infertility, post-partum depression and even infanticide, insofar as they are phenomena that deviate from psychological normality.";

TI  - Assessing traumatic reactions of abortion with the emotional stroop
AU  - Toledano, Levana
PY  - 2004
PD  - 
AB  - The psychological consequences of abortion have been widely investigated since legislation associated with the historical 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision was overturned. Contradictory conclusions regarding the impact of abortion exist in the literature today due to political, social, and moral biases and methodological shortcomings. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and abortion has been less frequently researched due to the politicizing of scientific studies and the continuing controversy that abortion creates. In addition, many debate the existence of PTSD following abortion, due to the elective and predictable nature of the procedure and its common occurrence in contemporary society. According to Speckhard and Rue (1992), however, a number of women suffer immediate, chronic, long-term, or delayed adverse emotional reactions following abortion. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether PTSD and its related symptoms are present in a sample of women following abortion. Two groups of women were included in this study: 59 women who had undergone an abortion and a control group of 28 women who had comparable surgical procedures. The mean age of the participants was 29.82, with ages ranging from 18 to 50 years. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Impact of Event Scale (IES), and the Emotional Stroop paradigm. The Emotional Stroop procedure utilized was a color-naming task comprised of abortion-relevant words (i.e., sex, pregnant, fetus), positive words, neutral words, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) words. Levels of depression and anxiety were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The role of social support at the time of abortion was measured via the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Background variables such as religiosity, the presence or absence of coercion, marital status, gestational length, number of children, and age were also explored as possible risk factors mediating responses to abortion. Multivariate tests indicated the presence of PTSD in both groups of women, but to a greater extent in the post-abortion group. The two groups reported similarly elevated scores for anxiety. Post-abortion women exhibited significantly longer response latencies on the Stroop for abortion/trauma-relevant stimuli as compared to the control group. There were no significant differences found between groups on measures of depression. Significant risk factors included low levels of perceived social support, younger age, and the presence of coercion. Implications for community and clinical psychology are outlined.

AB  - CONTEXT. Young women frequently cite concerns about the effects of unplanned pregnancies on future life course outcomes, including education, employment and relationships, as reasons for seeking abortion. There is relatively little evidence as to whether abortion leads to improved life course outcomes for young women who choose this option.METHODS: Data from 492 women participating in a 25-year longitudinal study of a New Zealand birth cohort were used in regression models that examined the relationship between pregnancy and abortion history prior to age 27 and selected social and economic outcomes at ages 21-25.RESULTS: Compared with young women who become pregnant before age 21 but did not seek an abortion, young women who had an abortion had significantly better outcomes on six out of 10 measures spanning education, income, welfare dependence and domestic violence. Adjustment for confounding factors indicated that most of these differences were explained by family, social and educational characteristics that were present prior to pregnancy. Nonetheless, even after adjustment for confounding factors, young women who had abortions had higher levels of subsequent educational achievement than those who became pregnant but did not have abortions.CONCLUSIONS: Abortion may mitigate some effects of early unplanned pregnancy. However, further study of its potential risks and benefits is needed so that women can make fully informed decisions as to whether to terminate unintended pregnancies.

AB  - Aim: This study explored maternal history of perinatal loss relative to risk of child physical abuse and neglect. Methods: The 518 study participants included 118 abusive mothers, 119 neglecting mothers, and 281 mothers with no known history of child maltreatment. Interviews and observations were conducted in the participants' homes, and comparisons were made between women without a history of perinatal loss and women with one and multiple losses relative to risk for child maltreatment. Results: Compared to women with no history of perinatal loss, those with one loss (voluntary or involuntary) had a 99% higher risk for child physical abuse, and women with multiple losses were 189% more likely to physically abuse their children. Compared to women with no history of induced abortion, those with one prior abortion had a 144% higher risk for child physical abuse. Finally, maternal history of multiple miscarriages and/or stillbirths compared to no history was associated with a 1237% increased risk of physical abuse and a 605% increased risk of neglect.Conclusion: Perinatal loss may be a marker for elevated risk of child physical abuse, and this information is potentially useful to child maltreatment prevention and intervention efforts.

The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was found to be significantly associated with younger age (< 24 years), being primigravid, married for less than 1 year, having an unsupportive husband, and a previous history of induced abortion. It is suggested that more attention needs to be paid to the mental health of pregnant women in developing countries (where pregnancy rates and the risks associated with pregnancy/delivery are much higher than in the developed countries) at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of health care.<BR>

Of these women, twenty-eight had had a prior therapeutic abortion and 216 women had no previous abortion. During their pregnancy and the postpartum period, the women completed a series of psychological and attitudinal measures. Analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of their demographic status, their obstetric experience or attitudes towards labour and birth. The study failed to demonstrate a relationship between anxiety during pregnancy and a prior abortion, nor were there any indications of inadequate maternal functioning. Women who had a prior abortion scored higher on the autonomy and nurturance subscales of the Personality Research Form, and had higher levels of depressive affect in the third trimester of pregnancy and in the postpartum period

Analysed suicide rates by the type of pregnancy (birth, induced abortion, or miscarriage) and by background characteristics of the mothers. Suggests that the increased risk of suicide after an induced abortion indicates either common risk factors for both or harmful effects of induced abortion on mental health.

AB  - Rates of total reported psychiatric disorder were no higher after termination of pregnancy than after childbirth. Women with a previous history of psychiatric illness were most at risk of disorder after the end of their pregnancy, whatever its outcome. Women without a previous history of psychosis had an apparently lower risk of psychosis after termination than postpartum. In women with no previous history of psychiatric illness, deliberate self-harm (DSH) was more common in those who had a termination or who were refused a termination. (Original abstract-amended)

AB  - Although physical, psychological, and social problems for chlidren born to women denied abortion have been identified, little attention has been paid to the role that close childspacing might play in contributing to those problems. Small chlidspacing intervals (less than two years) have been linked to numerous physical, psychological, and social problems for mother and child. Using secondary analysis, this study examines the characteristics of 596 mothers who sought abortions in 1987 by race and age. Nearly 25% of these mothers had at least one child under two years of age. Abortion patients with such young children were more likely to be Black and have low incomes than abortion patients with older children. More than half of the mothers studied had more than two children. The findings suggest that a substantial number of children born to women denied access to abortion would be closely spaced, with the resulting adverse health consequences falling more heavily on subpopulations of abortion patients already at higher risk for negative prinatal and neonatal outcomes.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between a history of induced abortion, and reproductive, contraceptive and demographic variables, as well as smoking, alcohol and drug use. Method(s): A cohort study was made at two family planning and one youth clinic. Out of 996 women, 192 (19.3%) reported a history of induced abortion, while the remaining 804 women sewed as a control group. In structured, personal interviews, the women were asked on details of these areas, including use of contraceptives and alcohol in different sexual situations, and about their partner. Result(s): Smoking alcohol and cannabis use were significantly more common among women who had undergone an abortion and in their partners, than in the control group. Alcohol use at the sexual debut, at the first intercourse with the latest partner and in occasion of casual sex was twice as common among the women in the abortion group. Severe alcohol intoxication leading to an unwanted intercourse was three times as common. Use of any contrceptive at first intercourse with a new partner was less common among the women in the abortion group, who also had a lower education, more childbirths and more often lived alone. Conclusion(s): The results could be used to define risk profiles in abortion prevention programmes.

AB  - A value-laden basis for commitment to goals and the behavioral and affective sequelae of commitment were examined in the context of a stressful life event. Fifty-seven women who were interviewed during a clinic visit for a pregnancy test (Time 1 [T1]) subsequently received positive test results and were then interviewed 2 days later (Time 2 [T2]) and a month later (Time 3 [T3]). The intentionality and the meaning of the pregnancy were associated with self-reported commitment to the pregnancy at T1. In turn, commitment predicted affective states both prior to (T1) and shortly after (T2) receiving test results. Initial commitment also predicted decisions to continue versus to terminate the pregnancy. The decision to continue the pregnancy appeared to bolster self-reported commitment. Relatedly, those continuing the pregnancy reported smoking fewer cigarettes at T3 than at T1. For those aborting the pregnancy, commitment at T1 was negatively related to adjustment at T3. Initial commitment predicted subsequent depression, guilt, hostility among those who aborted, whereas commitment predicted anxiety among those who continued the pregnancy. Other correlates of commitment (pregnancy concerns, religion, abortion history, and other life goals) were explored.

By use of special methods (questionnaires, a scala for gravity of psycho-social stress. Eysenck's [correction of Isenk's] test and self score diagnostic test), 63 adolescent pregnant girls were studied aged 13-16, of which 33 delivered and 30 terminated their pregnancies at will. Almost half of the girls were gypsies with little or no education and relatively healthy live style. In 70% of the cases family climate was saturated with conflicts. 48% of the pregnant girls accepted their pregnancy calmly, in 79% of the cases it was decided, 87% of the girls expected to marry the father of their children, and in 30% the children were left for adoption. 33% of the patient were victims of rape and had negative relationship towards their pregnancy. In 41% the pregnant women exhibited introversion and in 38%--extroversion and in those who delivered the ratio was almost the same In this same group moderate to intense stress was almost the rule, while among those who terminate their pregnancies light stress was observed. Neurotic tendencies among those who delivered was also observed, likely due to the reaction towards the process of difficult adaptation to the fact of the extramarital delivery. In the studied group we didn't observe extreme cases of social disadaptation reached crises of the pregnancy, abortion or delivery

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that grief responses do not differ between women who terminate their pregnancies for fetal anomalies and women who experience spontaneous perinatal losses. Method(s): A case-control study was conducted. Twenty-three women who underwent terminations through the genetics service of a tertiary referral obstetric hospital from January 1991 to April 1992 were assessed psychiatrically 2 months after the termination. The grief responses of these women on the Perinatal Grief Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory were compared to a demographically similar group of women assessed 2 months after they experienced spontaneous perinatal loss. Differences between the groups were assessed through one-way analysis of covariance. Result(s): After matching women in the two groups, it became clear that women who terminated for fetal anomalies were significantly older than women in the comparison group, and age was inversely correlated with intensity of grief. Therefore, age was covaried in comparing the grief responses of women in the two groups. Neither statistically significant nor clinically meaningful differences were found in symptomatology between the groups. By the time of assessment, four of 23 women (17%) who terminated their pregnancies were diagnosed with a major depression, and five of 23 (22%) had sought psychiatric treatment. Conclusion(s): Women who terminate pregnancies for fetal anomalies experience grief as intense as those who experience spontaneous perinatalloss, and they may require similar clinical management. Diagnosis of a fetal anomaly and subsequent termination may be associated with psychological morbidity.

Emotional consequences of the abortion were evaluated by before-and-after comparisons of the same measures in a subgroup of the aborting women. Findings indicated significantly greater distress in the aborting women, with lower levels after the abortion. The effects on emotional well-being of personal and contextual factors and their interactions are also examined.

The women who were about to abort exhibited a higher level of psychological distress which was also related to an underlying personality structure with neurotic traits. The group with a threatened miscarriage exhibited an intermediate level of psychological distress but a structure of personality similar to the antenatal group.

AB  - The study was conducted on 250 pregnant women who registered at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics of the Medical Faculty in Novi Sad with the intention of terminating their pregnancy. The specimen was divided into three groups on the base of pregnancy duration and the legal possibilities of its termination. The examined women were polled through a specially constructed questionnaire and the PSPI scale for the evaluation of the level of suicide capability and depressive state. It was determined that a high score in both scales existed only in those women where there was no possibility of legal termination for the existing pregnancy. The level of existing suicide capability and depressive state had shown to be statistically significant in relation to the other two groups of examined women. Out of the list of examined control variables, only the impossibility of pregnancy termination was high in correlation with the level of both suicide capability and state of depression in the bounds of the risk group, which gives this parameter the meaning of a suicidogenic factor in the conditions of our investigation.

In this study 15 pregnant women with an imminent abortion respectively an imminent preterm delivery had been investigated by the help of an anamnestic data questionnaire and different psychometric tests. This group had been opposed with a group of 91 women with an uncomplicated course of their pregnancy to disclose expected differences with regard to their personality profile, variables of their partnership and their adjustment, their experienced anxieties and anamnestic data, which shall be of importance for the outcome of the clinical symptoms. The results of this investigation show that among different psychogenic factors it is an asthenic personality profile coupled with neurotical and paranoid assimilation which reduces the psychic capacity of these pregnant women to cope with the adaptation processes of their occurred pregnancy and accuses the outcome of the clinical symptom complex of preterm labour.

Of 12 women requesting late abortion, seven underwent termination of pregnancy. All the women had severe social or psychological problems, or both. The main reasons for late presentation were denial of pregnancy, youth, and mental disorder. In a small group of atypical women late abortion seems to be justified for reasons other than fetal abnormality.

No significant difference in the incidence of depression between the two groups could be found. In addition, when associations between their mean depression scores and other variables such as planned pregnancy, preferred infant sex, identified obstetrical problems, help at home, experiencing the baby blues, and an identified recent sad life event were calculated, no significant differences were noted. Spontaneous comments from the previously aborted women suggested that anxiety during pregnancy concerning the infant's health was a greater source of discomfort than was postpartum depression.

AB  - Approximately 9 months after a legal therapeutic abortion, 188 Canadian women were interviewed. One half were single and the rest were married, separated or divorced. They were matched closely for a number of demographic variables with control women who had not had abortions. Neurotic disturbance in several areas of personality functioning was assessed from questionnaire responses. Out of 27 psychological scales, differences between the abortion and control groups were found on only 3: in general, women who had had abortions were more rebellious than control women, abortion tended to be associated with somewhat greater depression in married women, and single women who had had abortions scored higher on the shallow affect scale. However, all the personality scores were well within the normal range. Perceived social support was strongly associated with favourable psychological reactions after abortion. Use of contraceptives improved greatly after the abortion, when over 90% of women reported using contraceptives regularly.

AB  - Since 1975 (17th January), abortion is free and legal in France. The authors analyse 411 first cases of women requiring for an abortion (seen over a period of 11 weeks). Most of them are young women, single, many begin their sexual life. Unwanted pregnancy indicates absence of contraception by ignorance, refusal or ambivalence (never used = 184 cases). 105 women used archaic and inefficient contraceptive means. Modern contraceptive means was used by 154 women but ill applied, ill tolerated and/or discarded (pill = 103 cases, I.U.D. = 14, diaphragme = 2, condoms = 35). Unwanted pregnancy and abortion signify failure of contraception. We compare psychologic and psychopathologic features of women requiring repeated induced abortion with those of women suffering of repeated spontaneous abortion and infertility. These women have frequently (same) problems of feminine identity, bad maternal imago, absence of father, unhappy, and conflictive childhood, immature sexuality and personnality. Contradiction between conscious and unconscious wishes create the two opposite situations and intrapsychic conflicts (spontaneous abortion = conscious willing of pregnancy + unconscious rejection of unbearable pregnancy; induced abortion = strong but unconscious wish of pregancy + conscious and volontary rejection of maternity). Psychotherapy should improve sexual and affective life and in both cases. The authors compare infanticide and abortion behaviors, contraceptive means, and psychological problems of doctors who are asked abortion.

N1  - Julia Littell (2024-08-10 07:45:29)(Screen): Abstract: "The psychosomatic and psychological reactions of 75 women applying for a therapeutic abortion were compared with those of 33 women in the same state of pregnancy but not requesting an abortion. The abortion applicants differed significantly from the control group on 8 of the 10 scales tested. The abortion applicants had more prepregnancy health problems and more psychosomatic symptoms than the control group. They also showed more fears for themselves and the baby, less desire for pregnancy, more irritability and tension, less maternal feeling, and more depression and withdrawal than the control group. Parity was not as important in determining responses to the questionnaire as was the patients' abortion status. Literature on the use of pregnancy research questionnaires is reviewed. The possible transience of psychological compared to psychosomatic symptoms is suggested."

Most of the women in both groups were college students. Of the pregnant group, 40 percent were found to have motivational factors that may have influenced the occurrence of the pregnancy, such as guilt over use of contraception, a severe acting-out character disorder, or reactions to loss.

question whether any psychiatric indications for termination of pregnancy exist at all.
Religious considerations apart, there is a section of our profession which refuses
entirely to accept any such indication, whereas, at the other extreme, are those who
not merely accept, but who interpret these indications with considerable liberality.
Amongst the first group, a recent English writer [l] has stated that the main issue
facing the psychiatrist is whether or not a puerperal psychosis is likely to develop and,
if so, what the effects of this on the woman’s mental health are likely to be. The
writer goes on to state categorically, “There are no psychiatric grounds for the termination of pregnancy.” In the first place, the probability or otherwise of the development of a puerperal psychosis is not the main problem facing the psychiatrist and
this statement would, I think, find well-nigh universal acceptance amongst those with
any considerable experience of the problem. In affective illness, less than ever at the
present day, with modern methods of treatment, in the overwhelming majority of
cases-one might say practically all--no indication exists for therapeutic abortion.
Further, because a woman has had an affective illness with one pregnancy or childbirth,
there is no need to assume that she will have another such illness with her next pregnancy. She may or she may not. In such recurrent illnesses, a psychotic episode is
as likely to occur between pregnancies or childbirth as in association with them. It
should be unnecessary to reiterate this, were it not for the fact that time and again
patients with this history are referred for opinion on termination by worried General
Practitioners pressed by frantically anxious husbands to avert the anticipated dire consequences of another pregnancy and parturition. Schizophrenic illnesses are another
matter and will be discussed later. In general, the real problem facing the psychiatrist
asked to express an opinion on termination or not, lies not with the psychoses but with
the woman’s personality and/or her reaction to the pregnancy, and here one is on much
less sure ground. Another recent English writer [2], evidently in attempted rebuttal of
the extreme views just mentioned, states, “At present I have no doubt that termination is"; Trine Munk-Olsen (2024-07-17 18:55:43)(Screen): Appears to be a study that focus on the association mental health -> abortion and not the opposite direction which we are interested in. I will vote no;

Many, but not all, of the psychiatrically disturbed patients who were refused abortion became reconciled to the decision. The medical group who were aborted tended to view the operation as an unfortunate necessity. A decision for or against termination of pregnancy must take account of many factors previous psychiatric history, present mental state, patients attitude towards the pregnancy, marital adjustment personality structure and medical condition.

AU  - Hook K.

PD  - 
AB  - A report of a psychiatric follow-up study on 249 women whose applications for legal abortion were refused by the National Board of Health in Sweden in 1948. The ground! (medical, medicosocial, forensic and genetic) on which, according to the Swedish Abortion Act. a pregnancy in a woman may be terminated, are detailed. The carrying out of the follow-up examination is discussed. The follow-up material was studied from a number of different aspects and it was compared with the findings in women whose applications for legal abortion were approved. (1) Marital status: 48% were married, divorcees and widows together accounted for 8%. and unmarried women for 44%. (2) Age: the average age for married women was 30 yr. and for the unmarried women 23.2 yr. (3) Childhood environment: the occurrence of severe mental disturbance in the parents did not differ markedly from the average; broken homes were noted for 37% of the women. (4) Occupation outside the home and socioeconomic group: 33% of the married women and 87% of the unmarried women in the material were engaged in profitable work outside the home. (5) Male partner: mental disturbance, addiction to alcohol, or penalties for unlawful actions were reported in 20% of the partners. (6) Earlier pregnancies: 39% were pregnant for the first time and 35% were expecting the 3rd or further child. (7) Physical health: illness prior to the application, requiring sick-leave for longer than 2 months was recorded for 16% of the wowen. 55 Asocial behavi misdemeanours by juveniles were recorded in 4 cases. (9) Intellectual level: among the women tested, none had an I.Q. below 70. (10) Mental status: 10% had been compelled to seek medical help for mental illness or insufficiency before the application. (11) Recommendations for abortion had been given by the examining doctor to 93 (37%) of the women in the material. The high incidence of recommendations for medicosocial reasons (19%) is discussed. After refusal of permission for abortion. 86% of the women continued the pregnancy and had the child, 3% had a spontaneous miscarriage and 11% procured an abortion unlawfully. No suicides or suicidal attempts occurred after the refusal. In order to study the implications of threats to commit suicide or procure illegal abortion in the event of a refusal, a group of 273 women was studied; the outcome of this study is mentioned. Sixty-nine of the women were taking care of the child at the time of the follow-up examination; 12% had handed over the child to be cared for by others. The women's ability to take charge of the child depended in large measure on the state of her relations with the partner. Eleven women stated thai the male partner had been a chance acquaintance and in 90% the connection was regarded as a more or less permanent condition. The relationship with the partner at the time of the application for abortion is discussed; it proved to be of considerable prognostic value in indicating how the relationship would be in the future and what support she could expect when coping with her situation. Roughly 40% of the women became pregnant again within 3 yr. of delivery; altogether. 144 (59%) of the women who were not sterilized in connection with the delivery conceived again. At the follow-up examination, 53% of the women reported they used contraceptives regularly. About the attitude to the pregnancy and to the child, 73% of the women expressed satisfaction at the way things had turned out, and 27% would have preferred to have had a legal abortion. Eighty-one per cent of the women classified as normal were satisfied with the situation while 40% of those with mental deviations expressed dissatisfaction. The married women showed a better adjustment than the unmarried women. Poor adjustment was noted in 42% of the women with deviating personalities and in 12% of the women classified as normal. Judging by the frequency of poor adjustment and mental sequelae in the follow-up material a request for legal abortion, especially by women with mental deviations, suggests the presence of conflicts in the environment and mental frailty to cause insufficiency reactions when the women are subjected to the increased burden and stress implied by an unwanted pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant teenagers often prolong the interval between suspecting and confirming that they are pregnant. Prior studies suggest a number of potential determinants for this delay but do not specify which ones are most salient., METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, 123 pregnant teenagers, 64 of whom maintained their pregnancies and 59 of whom had abortions, completed a short version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Family APGAR test, and a study-specific questionnaire., RESULTS: Significant bivariate determinants of delayed pregnancy testing included young maternal age, black race, lower educational attainment, lack of pregnancy symptoms, continuing the pregnancy, and denial. Only denial, however, retained a significant net effect on delayed testing (P < .05) when the effects of these six variables were modeled using multiple linear regression., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that psychological barriers are the most salient determinants of delayed pregnancy testing among the teenagers surveyed in this study. Some teenagers may not volunteer information about a suspected pregnancy. Providers, therefore, should directly question teenagers about sexual activity and discuss the importance of early testing when pregnancy is suspected. Findings also suggest further research that would increase understanding of adolescent health behavior in pregnancy and identify effective clinical and educational interventions.

PD  - 
AB  - Studies of the consequences of adolescent childbearing report many negative sequelae, but the effects of induced abortion are less studied, and most studies lack appropriate controls for preexisting characteristics. This paper uses baseline data from the intake interview into a longitudinal study of 360 innercity black women (less than or equal to 17 years old) presenting for a pregnancy test at two sites in Baltimore to examine baseline differences between three groups: young women who terminated the index pregnancy and, as controls, those who carried to term and those whose tests were negative. They were interviewed before being told the test result. Education aspirations/achievement, economic well-being, sexual/contraceptive history, psychologic characteristics, and desire for a child were compared. Negative test patients often reveal characteristics suggesting a particularly high risk of pregnancy, e.g., more prior pregnancy tests and a greater desire to conceive. Implications are discussed, emphasizing the need to intervene after a negative pregnancy test with counseling to help avert a future undesired conception.

AB  - 117 (45%) of the 263 women of German nationality who underwent socially indicated abortions in the postal-code area 2300 (Kiel) in the first quarter of 1982 were investigated before the abortion as well as one year later. As far as age, marital status and number of children were concerned, these women did not differ significantly from the other 55%. One year later information was collected on the women's emotional adjustment by means of a questionnaire concerning feelings of guilt and loss, personal reports of adjustment process and the investigator's judgement. According to the findings, 79% of the women had adjusted without any problems, 14% were still in a state of emotional imbalance, 7% were clearly impaired emotionally and in their everydays functioning. 21% of the women, who had adjustment problems, had already been more depressive before the abortion. One year later, they were also more depressive than the other women, more dissatisfied with their lives in general and with their sex lives. They were in greater doubt as to whether they had made the right decision, showed less inclination to consider a further abortion and reported stronger post-abortive feelings of guilt. Significantly connected with later emotional difficulties were low social class, a difficult financial situation, lack of intrapsychic differentiation between sex and reproduction, no partner or negative relation with partner and partner disagreements, particularly in the case where the male partner was more in favour of abortion than the woman. Statistically insignificant, although tendencially noticeable were social isolation, non-employment and pre-pregnancy psychical problems. Age, marital status, number of children, simultaneous abortion/sterilisation, previous abortions, a broken home in the patient's youth had no effect on the emotional adjustment after the abortion. The common factor of all variables predicting post-abortive emotional problems seems to be an external motivation for abortion together with a greater ambivalence towards the pregnancy.

Abstract
In this study of reproductive problems and women's reactions to them, 30% reported an unplanned pregnancy, 13% had infertility problems, 4% had an abortion, 18% had a miscarriage, 5% experienced infant death, 18% had difficult pregnancies or delivery, 15% had a tubal ligation, and 15% had an hysterectomy. There were marked psychological responses of depression and increased stress which improved as the women learned more about the problem and drew closer to their families and others with similar problems.;

PIP: Several studies (Senturia and Rothman, 1967; Simon et al., 1969; Stewart et.al., 1973) have shown that therapeutic abortion may be accompanied by various psychological problems (e.g., psychiatric illness, confused sexual identity, sadomasochism). This study attempts to determine the personality characteristics, e.g., extraversion-introversion, neuroticism-stability and manifest anxiety of women who seek abortion and compare them with a control group. The Eysenk Personality Inventory and the Manifest Anxiety scale adapted by George (1965, 1974) were administered to 2 groups, the experimental group (n=50; mean age, 25.8) consisting of women seeking abortion, and the control group (n=30; mean age, 25.4 years; matched for age and socioeconomic status with the experimental). Mean values for extraversion-introversion, neuroticism-stability, and manifest anxiety for the experimental group were 11.08, 15.5 and 23.74 respectively. Corresponding figures for the control group were 11.00, 10.46, and 11.96 respectively. The results show that the experimental group differed significantly from the control group in the dimensions of neuroticism and manifest anxiety. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of extraversion. The stressful nature of pregnancy is briefly discussed.;

AU  - Bensyl, Diana Miller
PY  - 1999
PD  - 
AB  - Prior research into the effects of substance use during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes has relied heavily on cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies are vulnerable to social desirability and recall biases so these studies may yield misleading results. The objective of this project was to examine the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs on pregnancy outcomes for women in a national longitudinal survey that was less vulnerable to bias.    The National Youth Survey, a longitudinal national probability survey that followed 1,725 subjects who were 11 to 17 years old at the initial assessment, was used to determine pregnancy outcomes including elective abortion, problem pregnancy and miscarriage. These outcomes were examined among female subjects (N = 807) across six assessment periods over an eight-year time period using generalized logit models.    These models showed that subjects who used alcohol, cocaine, or amphetamines were significantly more likely to seek elective abortions than non-users. Weekly alcohol users and daily tobacco users also experienced significantly more problem pregnancies than non-users. Victimization was shown to be associated with decreased normal pregnancies. Higher SES was associated with fewer elective abortions. When tobacco and alcohol use were controlled for, the relationships remained significant for marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines suggesting use of alcohol and tobacco predicted negative outcomes better than use of illicit substances.

TI  - Psychosocial characteristics and sequelae of women psychiatric inpatients with reproductive losses of abortion and/or child custody relinquishment
AU  - Thomas, Tommijean
PY  - 1995
PD  - 
AB  - Seriously disturbed women, faced with unwanted, unintended, or unfeasible pregnancies, frequently consider the choice of abortion or relinquishment. No studies contrasting abortion and relinquishment within the psychiatric population are available as an aid to decision making. The present study, therefore, was undertaken.    Female patients with major psychiatric disorders were recruited and interviewed (using an originally designed instrument). Participants formed three groups: Abortion $(n = 36),$ Relinquishment $(n = 38),$ and Both Occurrences $(n = 45).$ They had mixed ethnicities, low socioeconomic status, an average age 40, and eleven years since their last reproductive loss. Groups were equivalent on psychiatric diagnoses and demographic variables.    It was hypothesized that the experience of relinquishment relative to abortion would be followed by more distressing emotional responses and disturbing psychosocial consequences. Opinions on reproductive losses and psychosocial characteristics were expected to differ among the three groups. Finally, it was predicted that interrelationships would be found between: (a) opinions on reproductive losses, (b) satisfaction with the decision/experience, and (c) responses to loss.    Significant results of the statistical analyses lent support to all hypotheses. With respect to relinquishment as opposed to abortion experiences: (a) more participants reported immediate symptoms and present psychiatric disturbances related to losses, (b) higher negative scores on scales of immediate symptoms, current disturbances, and emotions were reported. The findings contradicted past research in that participants coped better with abortion than previously asserted and suggested that patients considering relinquishment should be informed of the traumatic sequelae.    Participants with both kinds of reproductive losses had significantly higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, rape, and past substance abuse. Thus, they may need special attention and evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder. Significant correlational findings suggest that the study variables have predictive value and may be useful in helping a woman when she is considering terminating a pregnancy by abortion or giving up the custody of a child. Health care costs are discussed and increased family planning services is suggested as well as obtaining reproductive histories on a routine basis. The findings imply that reproductive losses have not been adequately addressed for these patients and more research in this area is needed to better understand and help them.

AB  - Explored the postpartum transitory depression syndrome by evaluating the depression levels of 47 women (aged 13–42 yrs), using the Self-Rating Depression Scale and a brief clinical interview at 7 mo pregnancy, 7 days postpartum, and 6 wks postpartum. Ss also completed the Tennessee Self Concept Scale and the Marital Adjustment Test. Findings indicate that Ss were significantly more depressed during the 7th mo of pregnancy and the 1st postpartum wk than they were at 6 wks postpartum. No significant difference was found between levels of depression at the 7th mo of pregnancy and the 1st postpartum wk. The relationship of marital adjustment, self-concept, and other variables to level of depression before and after childbirth was also studied. A multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the best predictors of early postpartum depression. Predictors included level of depression during the 7th mo of pregnancy, self-concept, age, women's plans to terminate her job because of the infant, previous loss of fetus due to abortion or miscarriage, and ethnic background.

AB  - Studies of the consequences of adolescent childbearing report many negative sequelae, but the effects of induced abortion are less studied, and most studies lack appropriate controls for preexisting characteristics. This paper uses baseline data from the intake interview into a longitudinal study of 360 innercity black women (≤17 years old) presenting for a pregnancy test at two sites in Baltimore to examine baseline differences between three groups: young women who terminated the index pregnancy and, as controls, those who carried to term and those whose tests were negative. They were interviewed before being told the test result. Education aspirations/ achievement, economic well-being, sexual/contraceptive history, psychologic characteristics, and desire for a child were compared. Negative test patients often reveal characteristics suggesting a particularly high risk of pregnancy, e.g., more prior pregnancy tests and a greater desire to conceive. Implications are discussed, emphasizing the need to intervene after a negative pregnancy test with counseling to help avert a future undesired conception. © 1990.

PD  - 
AB  - To test the hypothesis that primiparas who have had a previous elective abortion will have a higher incidence of depressive reactions postpartum than will primiparas who have not, 48 women pregnant for the first time and 25 who had had one abortion were interviewed six to eight weeks postpartum. No significant difference in the incidence of depression between the two groups could be found. In addition, when associations between their mean depression scores and other variables such as planned pregnancy, preferred infant sex, identified obstetrical problems, help at home, experiencing the baby blues, and an identified recent sad life event were calculated, no significant differences were noted. Spontaneous comments from the previously aborted women suggested that anxiety during pregnancy concerning the infant's health was a greater source of discomfort than was postpartum depression.

AB  - The psychosomatic and psychological reactions of 75 women applying for a therapeutic abortion were compared to those of 33 women in the same state of pregnancy but not requesting an abortion. Comparisons were made by means of the Pregnancy Research Questionnaire. The abortion applicants reported more health problems both prior to and during pregnancy than the control subjects but did not differ with respect to menstrual problems. While there was a high correlation between reported problems on the prepregnancy and pregnancy portions of the questionnaire for the control subjects, this was less obvious in the case of the applicants. In addition, the applicants reported considerably more negative psychological reactions than the control subjects. The effects of parity as a contributing variable were examined more briefly. © 1973.

PD  - 
AB  - A psychosociological study of the motivation for abortion in general, & repeated abortion in particular, based on chi-square analysis of questionnaire, interview, & inventory data collected from 23 repeated aborters, 28 first-time aborters, & a control group of 57 pregnant women who were not considering abortion. The following psychosociological variables were studied: relationship between the woman & her parents, relationship with the partner, occupation & professional involvement, number of living children & attitudes toward new children, attitude toward motherhood, & birth control. The findings indicate that first-time aborters typically face economic difficulties & are relatively young; the motivation for abortion is more of a physiological than a structural nature. Repeated aborters include more mature women (those aged 30+ constitute 52% of the group) whose motivations are structural. Repeated aborters have more difficult & unstable relationships with their partners, have a complicated family history, usually have children, & experience frequent failures in the use of birth control. Accordingly, they reveal a higher level of trait anxiety & general hostility. Preventive measures against repeated abortion should include the provision of more birth control information & education, family planning, & psychological counseling. 5 Tables, 23 References. M.

AB  - Psychiatric morbidity among 240 pregnant women attending an antenatal unit was assessed by a two-stage screening procedure, using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) and Present State Examination Schedule (PSE). The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was found to be significantly associated with younger age (<24 years), being primigravid, married for less than 1 year, having an unsupportive husband, and a previous history of induced abortion. It is suggested that more attention needs to be paid to the mental health of pregnant women in developing countries (where pregnancy rates and the risks associated with pregnancy/delivery are much higher than in the developed countries) at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of health care.

AB  - Background. We investigated whether reported psychiatric morbidity was increased after termination of pregnancy compared with other outcomes of an unplanned pregnancy.Method. This was a prospective cohort study of 13261 women with an unplanned pregnancy. Psychiatric morbidity reported by GPs after the conclusion of the pregnancy was compared in four groups: women who had a termination of pregnancy (6410), women who did not request a termination (6151), women who were refused a termination (379), and women who changed their minds before the termination was performed (321).Results. Rates of total reported psychiatric disorder were no higher after termination of pregnancy than after childbirth. Women with a previous history of psychiatric illness were most at risk of disorder after the end of their pregnancy, whatever its outcome. Women without a previous history of psychosis had an apparently lower risk of psychosis after termination than postpartum (relative risk RR=0.4, 95% confidence interval CI=0.3-0.7), bur rates of psychosis leading to hospital admission were similar. In women with no previous history of psychiatric illness, deliberate self-harm (DSH) was more common in those who had a termination (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6), or who were refused a termination (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.3).Conclusions. The findings on DSH are probably explicable by confounding variables, such as adverse social factors, associated both with the request for termination and with subsequent self-harm. No overall increase in reported psychiatric morbidity was found.

PD  - 
AB  - Termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality has become frequent with the increasing sophistication of techniques of antenatal diagnosis. The aim of this study was to obtain quantitative and qualitative information about psychiatric morbidity in women after termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality.Two samples of women were compared. The first consisted of 71 women who had had a termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality (FA group). The second consisted of 26 women who had experienced so-called missed abortion (MA group). Both groups had lost a pregnancy in the mid-trimester of pregnancy, but the MA group had no element of choice.Standardized psychiatric and social measures were used to assess both groups on three occasions after the termination. In both groups, 4 weeks after the termination psychiatric morbidity was high (four to five times higher than in the general population of women), and social adjustement was impaired. Six months and 12 months after the abortion, levels of psychiatric morbidity were near normal..Semi-structured interviewing was used to obtain information about the experience of grief after mid-trimester termination. For many women, symptoms of grief persisted throughout the year. These symptoms included typical features of grief as well as grief symptoms specific to pregnancy loss. The findings have implications for the counselling of women after termination for foetal abnormality or after missed abortion.

Abstract: "The change in paragraph 218 of the criminal code regarding abortion was responsible for new guidelines for the psychiatric evaluation regarding a therapeutic abortion is reported. The commonest indications were medical reasons such as exhaustion, and reactive depression. There was one case of schizophrenia, one case of affective psychosis, two attempted suicides, twenty reactive depressions, one character disorder, and one case of cerebral seizures. Five applications were approved. The follow-up evaluation of the women with the approved and dismissed applications for therapeutic abortions showed no physical or psychic abnormalities. A comparison with 88 German applicants showed similar results. The stringent evaluation of applications for therapeutic abortion is still necessary even after the change of the law.";

Thirty-eight were in the antenatal and 14 in the termination clinic. One quarter had probable psychiatric disorder on the GHQ. The GHQ scores correlated significantly with indecision about the planned outcome of pregnancy (whether termination or full term). Locus of control correlated with the Depression scale of the GHQ but not with attitude to pregnancy or choice of termination or delivery. Clinic staff should be alert to the psychiatric risks when seeing teenagers who have marked doubts about their plans when pregnant.

AB  - Background To examine the associations between adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes on substance use and suicide attempts in a sample who is at greater risk for substance use and suicide attempts - those who have been involved with the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. Methods Using a prospective, longitudinal design, we examined the role of adolescent pregnancy outcomes on risk for suicide attempts and substance use among a sample of 166 female adolescents with juvenile justice system and child welfare involvement. Results Of participants, 36% (n = 60) reported at least one adolescent pregnancy with a total of 109 pregnancies reported. Adolescent pregnancy was associated with an increase in later suicide attempts (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.06–2.72). Miscarriage was associated with a 2-fold increase in the likelihood of later suicide attempts, (aOR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.10–4.12). No participants who reported induced abortion (n = 13) reported suicide attempts. Adolescent pregnancy, miscarriage, and abortion were not significantly associated with later substance use (Ps > 0.05). Conclusions Healthcare professionals should conduct routine screening for suicidality in the months following a miscarriage, offer education to caregivers about how to support youth who experience pregnancy loss, provide additional social supports and familiarize themselves with local and virtual behavioral health resources to prevent suicide attempts among female adolescents who are at high risk and experience miscarriage.

PD  - 
AB  - Background: Reproductive health research among women who use drugs has focused on pregnancy prevention and perinatal/neonatal outcomes, but there have been few investigations of miscarriage and abortion, including prevalence and associated factors. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from a sample of non-pregnant women receiving harm reduction services in Philadelphia in 2016–2017 we examined lifetime miscarriage and abortion (n = 187). Separately for both outcomes, we used modified Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations with each correlate. We also explored correlates of reporting both miscarriage and abortion. Results: Approximately 47% experienced miscarriage, 42% experienced abortion, and 18% experienced both. Miscarriage correlates included: prescription opioid misuse (e.g., OxyContin PR 1.82, 95% CI 1.23, 2.69); 40% increase in prevalence associated with housing instability, 50% increase with survival sex, and two-fold increase with arrest. Abortion correlates included: mental health (e.g., depression PR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18, 3.71), stimulant use (e.g., methamphetamine PR 1.83, 95% CI 1.22, 2.74), and drug injection (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.03, 3.02); partner controlling access to people/possessions, physical and emotional violence; and a two-fold increase associated with survival sex and arrest. Experiencing both reproductive outcomes was correlated with mental health, opioid and simulant use, housing instability, survival sex, and arrest. Conclusion: Miscarriage and abortion was common among women with history of drug misuse suggesting a need for expanded access to family planning, medication-assisted therapy, and social support services, and for the integration of these with substance use services. Future research in longitudinal data is needed.

AB  - We report on women's mental health care desires following a miscarriage, medical termination, or abortion. 689 women completed a questionnaire on reproductive history, health care following miscarriage/medical termination/abortion, and current mental health. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses examined: miscarriage/termination/abortion incidence, desires for mental health support following miscarriages/terminations/abortions, and current mental health. Of 365 women with a pregnancy history, 37% reported ≥1 miscarriage, 9% ≥1 medical termination, 16% ≥1 abortion, and 3% endorsed all three. Current mental health did not differ between women with a history of miscarriage/termination/abortion and those with only live births (p = 0.82). Following miscarriage, 68% of women discussed options for the medical management of pregnancy loss with their provider, 32% discussed grief/loss, and 25% received mental health care recommendations. Engagement in mental health services was reported by 16% of women with a history of miscarriage, 38% after medical termination, and 19% following an abortion. Of women who became pregnant after their most recent miscarriage/termination/abortion and did not receive mental health care, 55% wished they had received services during the subsequent pregnancy. Women desire mental health care after miscarriages, medical terminations, or abortions, warranting improved access to mental health care for these individuals.

This study aimed to identify factors influencing postpartum depression in Bandar Lampung City, Indonesia, in 2023 using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale instrument. This study employed a cross-sectional design with a sample size of 251 respondents, selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria using a purposive sampling technique. The multiple logistic regression results indicated that women with abortion records had a three times higher risk (95% CI = 1.394-7.648; p-value = 0.013) of experiencing postpartum depression after controlling for other variables (record of depression, employment status, education, and family support). Postpartum women should be followed by midwives and given regular assistance from their loved ones, such as their spouse or family, to prevent depression. These experts can monitor the mother's well-being and share information on maternal and infant health.

AB  - Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) are common occurrences that contribute to negative maternal and child health outcomes. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that trauma exposure and depression are drivers of the better-recognised risk factors for miscarriage, abortion and stillbirths. Our comparative cohort study based in Durban, South Africa recruited women who reported a recent rape (n = 852) and those who had never experienced rape (n = 853), with follow-up for 36 months. We explored APOs (miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth) among those having a pregnancy during follow-up (n = 453). Potential mediators were baseline depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, substance abuse, HbA1C, BMI, hypertension and smoking. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to determine direct and indirect paths to APO. Overall, 26.6% of the women had a pregnancy in the follow-up period and 29.4% ended in an APO, with miscarriage (19.9%) the most common outcome, followed by abortion (6.6%) and stillbirths (2.9%). The SEM showed two direct pathways from exposure to childhood trauma, rape and other trauma, to APO which were ultimately mediated by hypertension and/or BMI, but all paths to BMI were mediated by depression and IPV-mediated pathways from childhood and other trauma to hypertension. Food insecurity mediated a pathway from experiences of trauma in childhood to depression. Our study confirms the important role of trauma exposure, including rape, and depression on APOs, through their impact on hypertension and BMI. It is critical that violence against women and mental health are more systematically addressed in antenatal, pregnancy and postnatal care.

AB  - Background. Unwanted pregnancy can affect the sweet experience of motherhood and put a person at the crossroads of abortion or childbirth unaware of how each choice can affect a person's mental health, especially anxiety and depression. This study aimed to compare the rates of anxiety and depression between two groups of women with the experience of induced abortion and unwanted delivery. Methods. This research was conducted among 420 women with experience of unwanted pregnancy, including 210 women with a history of induced abortion and 210 women with a history of unwanted delivery. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were the main tools for gathering the related information. We collected demographic information, including marital status, age, number of children, occupation, and level of education. The associated data was analyzed based on an independent t-test using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software 19. Results. The results showed that the rate of anxiety among women with a history of unwanted delivery was higher than those with induced abortion. Although there was no significant difference in depression between the two groups, most subscales of depression such as feelings of failure, dissatisfaction, guilt, self-blame, suicidal ideation, crying, apathy, indecision, feelings of worthlessness, impotence, changes in sleep patterns, irritability, changes in appetite, difficulty in concentration, fatigue, and sexual apathy in the group with a history of abortion were higher than the group of women with a history of unwanted delivery. In addition, the rate of anxiety and depression was higher among single women with experience of induced abortion than married ones (P<0.05). Conclusion. According to the results, different levels of depression are more likely to occur among women who experience induced abortion under the influence of cultural, social, and religious factors. On the other hand, the level of anxiety among mothers who choose the path of childbirth in the situation of unwanted pregnancy is higher due to the responsibilities of parenthood. Furthermore, the relationships out of the formal marriage in traditional societies like Iran are taboos and do not meet social acceptance; so single mothers have to abort secretly without having the right to choose. This coercion can explain the higher rate of anxiety and depression among single women with a history of induced abortion than married ones. Practical Implications. The results of the present study can be used in the field of applied research and the development of preventive and therapeutic protocols and cover a large number of mothers and infants affected by anxiety disorders and depression due to unwanted pregnancies.

AB  - Background: Perinatal self-harm is of concern but poorly understood.Aims: To determine if women's risk of self-harm changes in pregnancy and the first postpartum year, and if risk varies by mental illness, age and birth outcome.Method: This was a retrospective cohort study of 2 666 088 women aged 15-45 years from the 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2017 linked to 1 102 040 pregnancies and their outcomes, utilising the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Pregnancy Register. We identified self-harm events and mental illness (depression/anxiety/addiction/affective/non-affective psychosis/eating/personality disorders) from clinical records and grouped women's age into 5-year bands. They calculated the rate of self-harm during discrete non-perinatal, pregnant and postpartum periods. We used a gap-time, stratified Cox model to manage multiple self-harm events, and calculated the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (adjHR) of self-harm associated with pregnancy and the postpartum compared with non-perinatal periods. Pre-planned interactions tested if risk varied by mental illness, age and birth outcome.Results: The analysis included 57 791 self-harm events and 14 712 319 person-years of follow-up. The risk of self-harm shrank in pregnancy (2.07 v. 4.01 events/1000 person-years, adjHR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.49-0.58) for all women except for 15- to 19-year-olds (adjHR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.84-1.07) and the risk reduced most for women with mental illness (adjHR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.36-0.44). Postpartum, self-harm risk peaked at 6-12 months (adjHR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15), at-risk groups included young women and women with a pregnancy loss or termination.Conclusions: Maternity and perinatal mental health services are valuable. Family planning services might have psychological benefit, particularly for young women.

AB  - To characterise the demographic and clinical characteristics of women who died by suicide in the perinatal period to inform and improve suicide prevention strategies. Retrospective analysis of maternal suicides during and within 1 year after the end of pregnancy in Queensland between January 2004 and December 2017. Outcomes measured included timing of death in relation to pregnancy, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and health service use prior to death. There were 65 deaths by suicide in the study period; six occurred during pregnancy, 30 occurred after a live birth, 22 occurred after a termination of pregnancy and seven followed a miscarriage or stillbirth. Most suicides were late maternal deaths. Women were younger, and more likely to identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, when compared to all women giving birth for the same time period. Most women had a prior mental health diagnosis, most commonly depression. Over half of women had recent relationship separation or conflict prior to death. Perinatal women had higher rates of death by violent means than all women in Queensland who died by suicide during the same time period. The demographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics of a group of women who died by suicide have been described, and this shows a high proportion of women with a prior mental health diagnosis. To reduce maternal mortality, psychosocial screening must be implemented broadly and continued until the end of the first year postpartum. Similar screening attention is needed for women who had a termination of pregnancy, miscarriage or stillbirth.

AB  - Background: Women with bipolar I disorder are at high risk for severe episodes after childbirth, but there is no study that provides an overview on bipolar episode risk both during pregnancy and after childbirth, miscarriage and induced abortion. The aim of this study was to determine the episode risk during all pregnancy outcomes subdivided by first and subsequent pregnancies.Methods: Participants were 436 women with bipolar I disorder from the Dutch Bipolar Cohort, having 919 pregnancies of which 762 resulted in a live childbirth, 118 ended in a miscarriage and 39 ended in induced abortion. Women reported on the occurrence of manic or depressed episodes during the perinatal period. Information about medication use was obtained by questionnaires.Results: Episode risk was 5.2% during pregnancy, and 30.1% in the postpartum period, with a peak in the early postpartum period. Risk of an episode was highest after live birth (34.4%), and lower after miscarriage (15.2%) and induced abortion (27.8%). Women with an episode during pregnancy or postpartum were less likely to have a second child compared to women with an uneventful first pregnancy (cOR=0.34; 95%CI: 0.22-0.51; p<0.001); if they had a second child their risk of an episode was significantly elevated with a subsequent pregnancy (cOR=6.17; 95%CI: 3.64-10.45; p<0.001).Limitations: Retrospective cross-sectional design with assessment (partial) through self-report in a homogeneous population.Conclusions: Women with bipolar I disorder have a six times higher risk of an episode after delivery compared to during pregnancy, therefore preventive strategies are particularly important immediately after delivery.

AB  - Objective: Little is known on the long-term risk of mortality following pregnancy loss. We assessed risks of premature mortality up to three decades after miscarriage, induced abortion, ectopic or molar pregnancy, and stillbirth relative to live birth.Study Design: We carried out a longitudinal cohort study of 1,293,640 pregnant women with 18,896,737 person-years of follow-up in Quebec, Canada, from 1989 to 2018. We followed the women up to 29 years after their last pregnancy event to determine the time and cause of future in-hospital deaths before age 75 years. We used adjusted Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of miscarriage, induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and stillbirth with premature mortality, compared with live birth.Results: Premature mortality rates were higher for most types of pregnancy loss than live birth. Compared with live birth, pregnancy loss was associated with an elevated risk of premature mortality (HRmiscarriage 1.48, 95% CI 1.33, 1.65; HRinduced abortion 1.50, 95% CI 1.39, 1.62; HRectopic 1.55, 95% CI 1.35, 1.79; and HRstillbirth 1.68, 95%. CI 1.17, 2.41). Molar pregnancy was not associated with premature mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33, 2.32). Miscarriage and induced abortion were associated with most causes of death, whereas ectopic pregnancy was associated with cardiovascular (HR 2.18, 95 % CI 1.39, 3.42), cancer (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.11, 1.73), and suicide-related mortality (HR 4.94, 95 % CI 2.29, 10.68). Stillbirth was associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR 4.91, 95 % CI 2.33, 10.36).Conclusion: Pregnancy loss is associated with an elevated risk of premature mortality up to three decades later, particularly cardiovascular, cancer, and suicide-related deaths.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal depression is the most common psychiatric disorder during pregnancy with serious consequences for the mother and the fetus. However, there are few studies about this health issue in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of antenatal depression and its associated risk factors among pregnant mothers attending antenatal care service at Jinka public health facilities, south Omo zone, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted on 446 pregnant women at Jinka public health facilities, from June 1 to June 30, 2018. Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess women's level of depression. Statistical package for social science version 20.0 was used for analysis. Logistic regression was used to find out the association between explanatory and depression. The strength of association was evaluated using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULT: The magnitude of antenatal depression in this study was 24.4% (20.2–28.5 at 95% CI) and it had statistically significant association with unmarried marital status adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 13.39 [(95% CI); (3.11–57.7)], chronic medical illness AOR = 3.97 [(95% CI); (1.07–14.7)], unplanned pregnancy AOR = 6.76 [(95% CI); (2.13–21.4)], history of abortion AOR = 2.8 [(95% CI); (1.14–7.02)], history of previous pregnancy complication AOR = 4.8 [(95% CI); (2.12–17.35)], and fear of pregnancy-related complications AOR = 5.4 [(95% CI); (2.32–12.4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one pregnant woman develops antenatal depression in every four pregnant women. Variables like unmarried marital status, chronic medical illness and unplanned pregnancy, history of previous pregnancy complications, and fear of pregnancy-related complications were associated with antenatal depression. Therefore, it is recommended that these risks factors should be evaluated during antenatal care with a view to improving maternal health.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Depression disorder during pregnancy and after childbirth is one of the mental illnesses that has adverse effects on maternal and neonatal health, especially infant growth and development. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors affecting depression disorder during pregnancy and after childbirth in Azarshahr in 2017-2018. Material and Methods: In this case-control study, all pregnant women with depression and the total number of women with postpartum depression in Azarshahr were considered as the case group. For the control group, 150 pregnant and delivered mothers were selected by systematic random sampling from Apple system. Statistical calculations were performed by using SPSS software version 16. Logistic regression test was used to compare the data in the case and control groups. Results: The prevalence of depression during pregnancy was 4.15% and the prevalence of postpartum depression disorder was 2.14%. There was a significant relationship between postpartum depression disorder and postpartum depression disorder with age, body mass index, spouse's job, number of previous children, number of previous daughters, household income, having a smoker husband, mother's daily physical activity and history of abortion. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression disorder during pregnancy in Azarshahr is higher than the provincial average. So, providing screening, diagnosis, treatment and support services for depression disorder in pregnant women in this city is essential. Considering the factors, high-risk mothers can be identified, and these services can be tailored for the high-risk group.

An association between a history of induced abortion and psychological well-being post-abortion has been demonstrated in recently published studies, which is contrary to the findings of existing known high-quality studies.

Material and methods

An evaluation was conducted to determine whether a history of abortion affected the psychological well-being and parental self-efficacy of first-time mothers and their partners; this assessment was performed when the child was aged 18 months. Questionnaires were administered to 492 first-time mothers, 37 of whom had a history of abortion, and their partners (n = 436). Women with previous miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and deliveries were excluded. The women were allocated to an abortion group or a comparison group, depending on each woman's abortion history obtained from medical birth registry data. Psychological well-being, which encompassed social and emotional loneliness, marital satisfaction, social phobia, and depression, was evaluated as a predictor of maternal and paternal self-efficacy within the two groups. The analysis was conducted using multi-group structural equation modeling.

Results

Induced abortion was not predictive of maternal or paternal well-being or parental self-efficacy. Overall, maternal and paternal psychological well-being was predictive of parental self-efficacy when an assessment was performed, regardless of an abortion history. After testing the invariance of multi-group models, psychological well-being was similarly found to predict parental self-efficacy in both the abortion history and comparison groups.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the psychological well-being of parents is an important predictor of maternal and paternal self-efficacy during toddlerhood. Abortion history was not demonstrated to negatively impact the psychological well-being of parents with respect to their capacity for parental self-efficacy.;

AB  - Introduction: Although suicide is the main cause of maternal death during pregnancy in industrialized countries, there are few research regarding the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation during pregnancy, especially in Spain. Method: In a multicenter study, the sample included 1,524 pregnant women recruited from an obstetrics setting from two Spanish tertiary-care public hospitals. The prevalence of prenatal suicidal ideation was estimated by analyzing their responses to item 9 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The risk factors (which increases the probability of having suicidal ideation) included sociodemographic and biomedical variables, and the stress subscale from the revised prenatal version of the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory (PDPI-R). Results: A total of 2.6% of pregnant women reported suicidal ideation. Risk factors of suicidal ideation during pregnancy include sociodemographic, such as prior history of depression (β = 0.120, p <.05), unemployment (β = 0.149, p <.05), and being an immigrant (β = 0.140, p <.01), and biomedical variables, such as previous abortion (β =0.169, p <.01) and assisted reproduction (β = -0.100, p <.05). Discussion: Given that the prevalence of suicidal ideation is higher than expected, the results of the study suggest the critical need for screening and designing preventive interventions adapted to pregnant women to decrease risk of associated suicidal behavior. In protocols carried out by midwives, specific risk factors should be included in health screenings during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Antenatal depression is a significant concern worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where prevalence rates vary widely. Understanding the socio-demographic and medical factors associated with antenatal depression is crucial for effective intervention and management. This study aims to assess the prevalence of antenatal depression and its relationship with various demographic, obstetric, and medical factors among pregnant women attending a tertiary healthcare hospital in Bhopal, India. Method(s): An observational cross-sectional study was conducted over 18 months, involving 500 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. Participants were assessed using a structured questionnaire covering demographic, obstetric, and medical factors. Antenatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Data analysis was performed to determine associations between depression and various factors. Result(s): The prevalence of antenatal depression was found to be 28.4%. Significant associations were observed between depression and socio-demographic factors such as younger age, lower education levels, lower socio-economic status, and belonging to extended or joint families. Medical factors such as stage of pregnancy, parity, marital conflict, unplanned pregnancy, preference for a male child, and past history of abortion were also significantly associated with antenatal depression. Conclusion(s): This study highlights the high prevalence of antenatal depression among pregnant women and identifies several socio-demographic and medical factors associated with its occurrence. Effective screening and management of antenatal depression, particularly among women with lower education levels, poorer socio-economic status, and limited family support, are essential for improving maternal and child health outcomes.Copyright © 2024 EManuscript Technologies.

AB  - Background: Although miscarriage and termination of pregnancy affect maternal mental illnesses on subsequent pregnancies, their effects on the positive mental health (e.g., eudaimonia) of both first-time and multi-time parents have received minimal attention, especially for fathers. This longitudinal study examines the effects of experiences of miscarriage and termination on parental well-being in subsequent pregnancies from prenatal to postpartum years, while simultaneously considering parity. Method(s): Pregnant women and their partners were recruited during early prenatal visits in Taiwan from 2011 to 2022 and were followed up from mid-pregnancy to 1 year postpartum. Six waves of self-reported assessments were employed. Result(s): Of 1813 women, 11.3 % and 14.7 % had experiences of miscarriage and termination, respectively. Compared with the group without experiences of miscarriage or termination, experiences of miscarriage were associated with increased risks of paternal depression (adjusted odds ratio = 1.6, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-2.27), higher levels of anxiety (adjusted beta = 1.83, 95 % CI = 0.21-3.46), and lower eudaimonia scores (adjusted beta = -1.09, 95 % CI = -1.99 to -0.19) from the prenatal to postpartum years, particularly among multiparous individuals. Additionally, experiences of termination were associated with increased risks of depression in their partner. Limitation(s): The experiences of miscarriage and TOP were self-reported and limited in acquiring more detailed information through questioning. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the decreased well-being of men whose partners have undergone termination of pregnancy or experienced miscarriage, and stress the importance of interventions aimed at preventing adverse consequences among these individuals.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, severity, and factors associated with antenatal depression among women receiving antenatal care at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Uganda. Antenatal depression is a critical concern for maternal and child well-being, as it is associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, abortion, low birth weight, and impaired maternal-infant bonding. Despite several international guidelines recommending routine screening for antenatal depression, local Ugandan guidelines often overlook this essential aspect of maternal care. Method(s): A cross-sectional study involving 353 pregnant women utilized the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) to assess antenatal depression. Participants were categorized as having antenatal depression if their total PHQ-9 score was >= 5 and met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for either major or minor depression. Psychosocial demographic and obstetric characteristics were recorded. Logistic regression analysis identified factors linked to antenatal depression. Result(s): The burden of antenatal depression was notably high, affecting 37.68% of the participants. Among those with antenatal depression, the majority exhibited mild symptoms 94 (70.68%). The significant factors associated with antenatal depression, revealed by multivariate analysis, included younger age (<= 20 years), older age (>= 35 years), history of domestic violence, alcohol use, gestational age, history of abortion, history of preeclampsia, and unplanned pregnancies. Conclusion(s): This study revealed a significantly high prevalence of antenatal depression, emphasizing its public health importance. Most cases were classified as mild, emphasizing the importance of timely interventions to prevent escalation. The identified risk factors included age, history of domestic violence, alcohol use, first-trimester pregnancy, abortion history, previous preeclampsia, and unplanned pregnancy.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background There are limited population-based data on the role of mental disorders in adolescent pregnancy, despite the presence of mental disorders that may affect adolescents' desires and decisions to become pregnant. Objective This study aimed to examine the relationship between specific types of mental disorders and pregnancy rates and outcome types among adolescents aged 13-19 years, using single-year age groups. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the MerativeTM MarketScan Research Databases. The study population consisted of females aged 13-19 years with continuous insurance enrollment for three consecutive calendar years between 2005 and 2015. Pregnancy incidence rates were calculated both overall and within the different categories of mental disorders. The presence of mental disorders, identified through diagnosis codes, was classified into 15 categories. Pregnancy and pregnancy outcome types were determined using diagnosis and procedure codes indicating the pregnancy status or outcome. To address potential over- or underestimations of mental disorder-specific pregnancy rates resulting from variations in age distribution across different mental disorder types, we applied age standardization using 2010 U.S. Census data. Finally, multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships between 15 specific types of mental disorders and pregnancy incidence rates, stratified by age.Copyright © 2024 Jeon et al.

AB  - Background: Increasing evidence suggests that pregnancy loss can lead to negative emotional outcomes, such as anxiety and depression, for women. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the long-term risk of mental disorders among individuals who have experienced pregnancy loss. Objective(s): To investigate the associations between pregnancy loss and the risk of common mental disorders. Method(s): In the UK Biobank, a total of 218,990 women without any mental disorder at baseline were enrolled between 2006 and 2010 and followed until October 2022. Information on the history of pregnancy loss was obtained through self-reported questionnaires at baseline. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between pregnancy loss and common mental disorders. Result(s): During a median follow-up time of 13.36 years, there were 26,930 incident cases of common mental disorders. Incidence rates of common mental disorders were elevated among women with a history of stillbirth (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23), miscarriage (HR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10), or pregnancy termination (HR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.17-1.25) compared to those without such experiences. Furthermore, the risk of common mental disorders significantly increased in women with two or more miscarriages (HR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.19) or two or more pregnancy terminations (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.30-1.48). Conclusion(s): Pregnancy loss is associated with an increased risk of common mental disorders in women later in life. These findings may contribute to the enhancement of long-term monitoring and prevention of common mental disorders for women with such a history.Copyright © 2024 Shen, Zhong, Wang, Fu and Mao.

AB  - Objective: Alcohol use is more common among female sex workers (FSWs). This study assessed the prevalence of lifetime and past-month alcohol use and related factors among FSWs in Iran. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1464 women from 8 major cities in Iran. Behavioral data were collected by trained interviewers and conducted face-to-face in a private room. Weighted analysis was used to determine the lifetime and past-month alcohol use prevalence. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the association between alcohol use and independent variables. Result(s): The most alcohol used in lifetime and past-month (weekly, less than once a week, and daily) in FSWs was 52.7% (12.25%, 12.94%, and 1.83%), respectively. In the final model, factors that were independently associated with alcohol use included the 31-40 years (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.13-5.15), education level of diploma (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.31-4.51), history of lifetime drug use (AOR = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.01-3.89), history of lifetime group sex (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.41-3.03), history of intentional abortion (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.06-1.92), six or more sexual clients in the last month (AOR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.80-5.87), history of lifetime anal sex (AOR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.82-3.35), and FSWs the married, temporarily married, and living with partner were positively associated with lifetime alcohol use. Conclusion(s): Alcohol use is prevalent among FSWs in Iran. Further prevention programs are needed to address and reduce harms associated with alcohol use among this vulnerable population in Iran. Designing intervention programs, it is suggested to consider other variables affecting alcohol use in FSWs.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: The number of pregnancies and interval between pregnancies can have significant impact on a woman's reproductive, psychological, and general health. Exposure to multiple reproductive losses is especially associated with higher rates of negative outcomes. Material/Methods: Medical records from 1999-2012 for all Medicaid beneficiaries born after 1982 in the 17 states that provide coverage for all reproductive services (N=2 162 600) were examined to identify the timing of subsequent pregnancies and their outcomes within 3 years of a first known pregnancy. Result(s): One year after their first pregnancy outcomes, 22.6%, 17.8%, and 11.7% of women who had an induced abortion, a natural loss, or a birth, respectively, conceived at least 1 additional pregnancy. By the second year, the percentage of repeat pregnancies rose to 37.5% after an abortion, 25.6% after a natural loss, and 23.1% after a birth. Graphing the weekly conception rates revealed that women who had abortions and natural losses showed similar patterns of rapid repeat pregnancy, with the rate of second conception spiking quickly within 3 to 4 months after the first pregnancy outcome. Conclusion(s): These findings support the clinical evidence that pregnancy loss may contribute to rapid repeat pregnancies and may better inform interventions to reduce rapid repeat pregnancies.Copyright © 2021 International Scientific Information, Inc..

AB  - Objectives: This presentation will describe the mental health and emotional consequences of receiving vs being denied an abortion for the pregnant person based on the 5-year longitudinal nationwide Turnaway Study. In addition to outcomes for the pregnant person, Diana Foster, PhD, will present data on how receipt or denial of abortion affects the well-being of the families' young children. Method(s): The Turnaway Study is a prospective longitudinal study examining the effects of unwanted pregnancy on women's lives. The major aim of the study is to describe the mental health, physical health, and socioeconomic consequences of receiving an abortion compared to carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. Result(s): The main finding of the Turnaway Study is that receiving an abortion does not harm the health and well-being of women, but in fact, being denied an abortion results in worse financial, health, and family outcomes. Conclusion(s): Dr. Foster will describe differences in the health and maternal bonding with children born from an unwanted pregnancy compared to those born from a new pregnancy subsequent to abortion. She will describe implications for clinical practice, including understanding the risks for patients whose parents have experienced lack of access to abortion care. CUL, EC, DEMFCopyright © 2023

AB  - Background & objectives: Mental health issues in pregnancy have adverse implications on the quality of life, however still they go unevaluated and underreported. Women with previous history of abortions or stillbirth may have a higher risk of experiencing mental health problems. The present investigation was aimed to study the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and domestic violence in antenatal women with prior pregnancy losses and the need for interventions to treat the same. Method(s): One hundred pregnant women with a history of prior pregnancy losses (group 1) and 100 women without obstetrical losses (group 2) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study carried out in a tertiary care hospital in India. Women were screened for depression, anxiety, stress and domestic violence using various questionnaires: EPDS (Edinburgh postnatal depression scale), PRAQ-2 (pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire-revised 2), GAD 7 (generalized anxiety disorder-7) and PSS (perceived stress scale). Result(s): The prevalence of depression (EPDS scale) and pregnancy specific anxiety (PRAQ-2 scale) was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (27 vs. 10%, P=0.008; and 15 vs. 6%, P=0.03). The prevalence of general anxiety (GAD 7 scale) and stress (PSS), however, was high and comparable in both the groups (33 vs. 29%, P=0.44; and 33 vs. 27%; P=0.35 respectively). Recurrent abortions was found to be an independent risk factor for depression [adjusted odds ratio=26.45; OR=28]. In group 1, 31 per cent required counselling in the psychiatry department and nine per cent required medication. Interpretation & conclusion: Mental health issues, especially depression, are prevalent in antenatal women with previous losses. Unrecognised and untreated, there is a need for counselling and developing screening protocols at India's societal and institutional levels.Copyright © 2023 Indian Journal of Medical Research.

AB  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common mental disorder among women and it can cause negative consequences for them, children, and families; however, accurate statistics and underlying factors on PPD and its severity are not available in Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, 200 women referred to an academic hospital for normal vaginal delivery, which had a full-term and single pregnancy and had passed between 6 weeks and 6 months of delivery, were selected by convenience sampling methods. The Edinburgh Depression Inventory and the checklist for demographic information of mothers were completed. Result(s): The prevalence of postpartum depression was 11.0% and 68.2% of mothers had a mild type. 31.8% had a history of depression. There was a significant relationship between the severity of postpartum depression in women with a previous history of depression (P = 0.012). Between postpartum depression and maternal age (P = 0.115), body mass index at delivery (P = 0.571), number of pregnancies (P = 0.693), number of deliveries (P = 0.446), number of abortions (P = 0.424), willing or unwilling pregnancy (P = 0.451), neonatal sex (P = 0.533), history of neonatal hospitalization (P = 0.725), previous history disease (P = 0.725) was no statistical association. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of PPD was approximately 11%, and there was a significant association between postpartum depression severity and a history of depression Physicians and policymakers should consider early screening for PPD, especially among women with previous depression.Copyright © 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether exposure to a first pregnancy outcome of induced abortion, compared to a live birth, is associated with an increased risk and likelihood of mental health morbidity. Material(s) and Method(s): Participants were continuously eligible Medicaid beneficiaries age 16 in 1999, and assigned to either of two cohorts based upon the first pregnancy outcome, abortion (n = 1331) or birth (n = 3517), and followed through to 2015. Outcomes were mental health outpatient visits, inpatient hospital admissions, and hospital days of stay. Exposure periods before and after the first pregnancy outcome, a total of 17 years, were determined for each cohort. Finding(s): Women with first pregnancy abortions, compared to women with births, had higher risk and likelihood of experiencing all three mental health outcome events in the transition from pre-to post-pregnancy outcome periods: outpatient visits (RR 2.10, CL 2.08- 2.12 and OR 3.36, CL 3.29-3.42); hospital inpatient admissions (RR 2.75, CL 2.38-3.18 and OR 5.67, CL 4.39-7.32); hospital inpatient days of stay (RR 7.38, CL 6.83-7.97 and OR 19.64, CL 17.70-21.78). On average, abortion cohort women experienced shorter exposure time before (6.43 versus 7.80 years), and longer exposure time after (10.57 versus 9.20 years) the first pregnancy outcome than birth cohort women. Utilization rates before the first pregnancy outcome, for all three utilization events, were higher for the birth cohort than for the abortion cohort. Conclusion(s): A first pregnancy abortion, compared to a birth, is associated with significantly higher subsequent mental health services utilization following the first pregnancy outcome. The risk attributable to abortion is notably higher for inpatient than outpatient mental health services. Higher mental health utilization before the first pregnancy outcome for birth cohort women challenges the explanation that pre-existing mental health history explains mental health problems following abortion, rather than the abortion itself.Copyright © 2023, Dove Medical Press Ltd.

Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of psychiatric morbidity at p < 0.05. A significantly higher proportion of pregnant women experienced psychological distress on the GHQ (51.8%) and psychiatric morbidity on SRQ (33.3%) compared with 28.6% and 18.2% of non-pregnant women, respectively. Predictors of psychiatric morbidity among pregnant women were the type of facility, poor satisfaction and communication with partners, the experience of violence in the home, previous abortions, and previous history of depression. Psychiatric morbidity among non-pregnant women was predicted by younger age, previous history of depression, poor satisfaction and communication with partners. There is a need for early identification of psychiatric morbidity among women of reproductive age, to ensure early interventions and prevent long-term disability.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Psychiatric morbidity has immense effects on a woman's quality of life, social functioning, obstetric outcome, and economic productivity. What do the results of this study add? Psychiatric morbidity among women of reproductive age is high. Pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant women had significantly higher rates of psychiatric morbidity. This high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in both groups was predicted by poor satisfaction and communication with partners, and a previous history of depression. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Simple screening for women of reproductive age attending healthcare facilities may help with the early identification of psychiatric morbidity leading to prompt interventions, and preventing long-term disability.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background Postpartum depression (PPD) is a disabling but treatable mental disorder that represents one of the most common complications of childbearing which can exert a wide range of effect on social, physical and mental health conditions of the mother and baby. Objective To identify the prevalence and factors associated with postpartum depression among mothers visiting immunization clinic at Birendranagar Municipality, Surkhet in year 2020. Method This study was a cross-sectional study. A total of 347 postpartum mothers were interviewed for data collection. Validated Nepali version of Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to identify postpartum depression. These mothers were permanent resident of Birendranagar who had delivered their babies in municipal hospital. Analysis was done using SPSS version 21.0. Chi square test was applied to identify association of postpartum depression with major interest of variables namely parity of mother, sex of a baby and recent planned or unplanned pregnancy. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Result The prevalence of postpartum depression was found to be 32.9% (27.9%, 37.8%). Several factors which were significantly associated with postpartum depression were; sex of the baby, history of abortion and recent pregnancy planned or unplanned. Conclusion Nearly one-third of postpartum mothers had depression. Hence screening of mothers for depression is of prime importance throughout the continuum of care. Likewise, the factors identified for postpartum depression needs to be taken care of well in advance for healthy mother and a baby.Copyright © 2022, Kathmandu University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effect of pregnancy history on the incidence of depression and anxiety symptoms among early pregnant women. Methods A total of 9 516 early pregnant women were recruited from Obstetric Clinic of the Chongqing Maternal and Child Health Hospital during Disorder-7 items (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionaire-9 items (PHQ-9), respectively. Univariate analyses were used to detect the influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms, and logistic analyses were used to evaluate the effect of pregnancy history on the incidence of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 18. 9% and 47. 5% among early pregnant women, respectively. Results of univariate analyses indicated that age, BMI (before pregnancy), smoking history, alcohol drinking history, allergies, parity, and abortion number were related to anxiety and depression symptoms. After adjusting for confounders, logistic analyses showed that primipara had higher risk of anxiety symptoms than multipara (OR = 1. 16, 95% CI: 1. 01-1. 33, P = 0. 031). Abortion was associated with increased odds for anxiety (OR = 1. 26, 95% CI: 1. 13-1. 41, P<0. 001) and depression (OR =1. 19, 95% CI: 1. 09-1. 29, P<0. 001) symptoms, respectively. Conclusion Our study suggested that primipara and abortion were important risk factors for depression and anxiety symptoms in early pregnant women.Copyright © 2023, Publication Centre of Anhui Medical University.

AB  - Objectives: To assess if method of pregnancy management impacts psychological outcomes among patients pursuing trio-ES for genetic diagnosis. Method(s): Secondary analysis of a prospective trio-ES study, enrolling patients with a pregnancy with any major fetal anomaly and normal microarray after genetic counseling. All patients decided on pregnancy termination or continuation prior to enrolling. Patients agreed to learn: (1) findings that explain the fetal phenotype, (2) medically actionable secondary findings in a parent, or (3) carrier couple status for significant autosomal recessive conditions. Variants resulting from ES were interpreted as likely pathogenic, pathogenic, or of uncertain significance. The pregnant patient from each trio completed validated scales and short-free responses before and after sequencing. Psychological outcomes were compared between those who terminated or continued. Thematic content in free responses was analyzed. Result(s): 166 trios have been sequenced thus far. 90 patients provided information about pregnancy management. 60 (67%) elected to terminate a pregnancy and 30 elected to continue. Those who terminated were more likely to be employed, have income >$75,000, and were less likely to have a prior anomalous pregnancy (Table 1). There was no difference in genetic knowledge or anxiety and depression scores between groups pre-sequencing. 29 (32%) received an informative result from ES; of those, 24 had terminated. After sequencing, all who had terminated were less certain about test results and had worse psychological adaptation scores compared to those who continued. Overall and subscale scores did not differ based on specific ES results. There was no difference in decisional conflict between groups (Table 1). In free response, patients hoped ES would support a pregnancy management decision (Table 2). Conclusion(s): Individuals who continued their pregnancies had more difficulty with adaptation of genetic information in the context of their situation; this may be related to uncertainty surrounding a result. Additional studies are needed to inform how pregnancy management and genetic results relate.

AB  - Purpose In addition to estimating the prevalence of intentional abortion in Iranian female sex workers (FSWs), this study identified related factors using the data of a national study. Methods This cross-sectional study utilizes the third round of integrated bio-behavioral surveillance-III data in Iranian FSWs in December 2019 and August 2020, and 1515 Participants were selected in 8 geographically diverse cities in Iran. Logistic regression was performed using unweighted analysis to identify factors associated with intentional abortion. Stata software (version 14), respondent-driven sampling analyses, and R (version 4.1.2) was used for data analysis. Results From 1390 participants with valid responses to the abortion question, 598 (37.3%; 95% CI: 32.43, 42.11%) reported intentional abortion during their life. According to the age groups, the highest prevalence of abortion was in the age group of 31 to 40 years (42.60%). In the multivariate logistic regression model, the marital status (divorced women (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.27), concubines (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.11)), work experience in brothels (AOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.84), the type of sex (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.35, 5.58), the history of sexual violence (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.01), and alcohol consumption (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.01) were significantly associated with a history of intentional abortion. Conclusion Intentional abortion's prevalence among Iranian FSWs has been much higher than that of the general female population in Iran, which is an alarming issue in the public health of this group and needs more effective interventions. In addition, alcohol consumption, working in a brothel, and being divorced are essential factors in increasing abortions among sex workers.Copyright © 2022 Moradi et al.

AB  - Background: Antenatal common mental disorder is a significant public health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries with an extensive treatment gap. Common mental disorders have multifaceted implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy with long-running economic and social sequels. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of common mental disorder and associated factors among pregnant mothers in eastern Ethiopia, Kersa and Haramaya Health, and Demographic surveillance sites. Method(s): A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kersa and Haramaya health and demographic surveillance sites from January 30 to April 30, 2021. World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to measure common mental disorder among 1,015 randomly selected pregnant women. Data were collected face-to-face using open data kit software. Logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with common mental disorders. Result(s): The overall prevalence of common mental disorders (SRQ > 6) among pregnant women was 37.5% (95% CI: 34.5, 40.5). Current substance use (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.37, 2.88), intimate partner violence (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI 2.02, 3.53), null parity (AOR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.65, 5.84), gestational age [first trimester (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.01, 4.93) and third trimester (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.31, 2.31)], history of abortion (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.27, 3.24), and absence of antenatal care follow-up (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.08, 1.89) were significantly associated with common mental disorder during pregnancy. Conclusion(s): Common mental disorders are prevalent among pregnant women in the study area with significant correlates. Administration of regular screening programs for maternal mental health conditions in rural, low-income communities, integrating into primary health care settings is imperative to reduce the risk.Copyright © 2022 Tamiru, Misgana, Tariku, Tesfaye, Alemu, Weldesenbet, Gebremichael and Dheresa.

PD  - 
AB  - Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are common health concerns that affect women globally, especially during antenatal period. In Pakistan, these issues are under emphasized and considered stigma when compared qto developed countries. This can hit any pregnant women. Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors related to antenatal depression and GAD among pregnant women. Design(s): This is a cross-sectional study with non-probability sampling conducted on pregnant women visiting antenatal clinics. Methodology: The study is conducted in four Tertiary Care Hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan over the period of six months. A pre-designed questionnaire was filled after written informed consent. A validated GAD-7 scoring was used to objectify the frequency of depression and anxiety among participants. The data was analyzed by SPSS 23. Result(s): Among 500 woman, according to PHQ-9, 74% had minimal depression, 14% had mild depression, 8% had moderate depression, 6% had moderately severe depression and 2% had severe depression. Out of moderately severe and severely depressed women 10% were in first trimester of pregnancy, 38% in second trimester and 52% were in third trimester.78% women with depression had >=4 factors present in their history. The most common factors associated with depression were physical violence (54%) and lack of partner support (52%). According to GAD-7 scoring, 82% had minimal anxiety, 10% had mild anxiety, 6% had moderate anxiety and 2% were severely anxious. Out of moderately and severely anxious women, 58% were in their first trimester. 28% were in second trimester and 14% were in third trimester. The most common factors associated with moderate and severe GAD were past history of abortion (34%) and past history of still birth (32%). Lack of partner support and In-Laws support was present in 28% and 22% of women with GAD. The best coping methods used by the women with depression and GAD were offering prayers and Exercise/Yoga. Conclusion(s): Pregnant women experience depression more in their second and third trimester with leading factors of physical violence and lack of partner support while anxiety hit them in their first and second trimester more ofently. The most common risk factors were previous bad obstetrical history and lack of spouse support. Screening methods and establishment of counselling sessions for anxiety and depression should be incorporated in existing antenatal programs for detection and treatment of early symptoms of these psychiatric issues.

AB  - Objective: To determine if, based on results from international studies, pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for postpartum depression in the US. Also, to examine health and demographic variables and their association with postpartum depression to assist in determining additive impact. Study Design: This is a retrospective case-control study created to analyze preexisting data collected by the Community Child Health Network, a dataset in the NIH Data and Specimen Hub database. The dataset includes chart reviews and interviews of 3,079 mothers during the prenatal, perinatal, and multiple postpartum periods around the country. Variables identified as possible risk factors were the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, maternal age, ethnicity, race, education, income level, insurance, tobacco use, gravida, parity, abortions, number of fetuses, presence of infection or illness in pregnancy, delivery method, complication indicating delivery, and NICU admission. Outcomes were defined as early (2-16 wks) and late (24-65 wks) postpartum depression with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 10 or more in each time period. Logistic regression analysis was done to form models for Early and Late postpartum depression and identify odds ratios for each study variable. Result(s): Of the 3079 original patients, 1216 met study criteria. Pre-Eclampsia was not a significant predictor of early (OR=1.008, 95% CI: 0.43-2.362) or late (OR=0.971, 95% CI: 0.468-2.015) postpartum depression. Number of Preterm births was associated with early postpartum depression (OR=1.485, 95% CI: 1.02-2.163). Smoking (OR=1.603, 95% CI: 1.022, 2.515) and Medicaid for insurance (OR=1.802, 95% CI: 1.108, 2.931) were associated with late postpartum depression. Conclusion(s): A change in the definition of pre-eclampsia over time could explain why we could not demonstrate the association between this and postpartum depression seen in other studies. Logistic regression models estimating the additive impact of our study variables on early and late postpartum depression were created, though not statistically strong.

AB  - Objective: Little is known on the long-term risk of mortality following pregnancy loss. We assessed risks of premature mortality up to three decades after miscarriage, induced abortion, ectopic or molar pregnancy, and stillbirth relative to live birth. Study design: We carried out a longitudinal cohort study of 1,293,640 pregnant women with 18,896,737 person-years of follow-up in Quebec, Canada, from 1989 to 2018. We followed the women up to 29 years after their last pregnancy event to determine the time and cause of future in-hospital deaths before age 75 years. We used adjusted Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of miscarriage, induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and stillbirth with premature mortality, compared with live birth. Result(s): Premature mortality rates were higher for most types of pregnancy loss than live birth. Compared with live birth, pregnancy loss was associated with an elevated risk of premature mortality (HRmiscarriage 1.48, 95% CI 1.33, 1.65; HRinduced abortion 1.50, 95% CI 1.39, 1.62; HRectopic 1.55, 95% CI 1.35, 1.79; and HRstillbirth 1.68, 95%. CI 1.17, 2.41). Molar pregnancy was not associated with premature mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33, 2.32). Miscarriage and induced abortion were associated with most causes of death, whereas ectopic pregnancy was associated with cardiovascular (HR 2.18, 95 % CI 1.39, 3.42), cancer (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.11, 1.73), and suicide-related mortality (HR 4.94, 95 % CI 2.29, 10.68). Stillbirth was associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR 4.91, 95 % CI 2.33, 10.36). Conclusion(s): Pregnancy loss is associated with an elevated risk of premature mortality up to three decades later, particularly cardiovascular, cancer, and suicide-related deaths.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Antenatal depression has immense public health importance, as it can adversely affect both the mother and child health. The problem contributes to the disease burden in both developed and developing countries. Despite this, it is less investigated and not getting the necessary attention in the study setting. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of antenatal depression and associated factors among women attending antenatal care (ANC) service in Kochi Health Center, Jimma town, southwest Ethiopia, 2019. Method(s): Institutional based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 314 pregnant women attending Kochi Health Center from February 15 to April 15, 2019. A systematic random sampling technique was used to include the study participants. Antenatal depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was done to summarize the dependent and independent variables. Moreover, the chi-square test analysis was done to determine the association between the outcome and explanatory variables. Result(s): A total of 314 pregnant women participated in the study, making a response rate of 96.7%. The study has revealed a total of 52 (16.6%) of the respondent had antenatal depression. A chi-square test of independence analysis showed a significant association between antenatal depression and marital status, family history of depression, pregnancy planning, history of abortion, social support, and intimate partner violence (P < 0.00001). Conclusion(s): The study has shown that the prevalence of antenatal depression was high and associated with multiple psychosocial, clinical, and obstetric factors. Therefore, screening pregnant women for depression and the provision of necessary mental health services is recommended to mitigate the adverse health outcome of the problem.Copyright © 2021 Yonas Tesfaye and Liyew Agenagnew.

AB  - Pregnancy loss, natural or induced, is linked to higher rates of mental health problems, but little is known about its effects during the postpartum period. This study identifies the percent-ages of women receiving at least one postpartum psychiatric treatment (PPT), defined as any psychiatric treatment (ICD-9 290-316) within six months of their first live birth, relative to their history of pregnancy loss, history of prior mental health treatments, age, and race. The population consists of young women eligible for Medicaid in states that covered all reproductive services between 1999- 2012. Of 1,939,078 Medicaid beneficiaries with a first live birth, 207,654 (10.7%) experienced at least one PPT, and 216,828 (11.2%) had at least one prior pregnancy loss. A history of prior mental health treatments (MHTs) was the strongest predictor of PPT, but a history of pregnancy loss is also another important risk factor. Overall, women with a prior pregnancy loss were 35% more likely to require a PPT. When the interactions of prior mental health and prior pregnancy loss are examined in greater detail, important effects of these combinations were revealed. About 58% of those whose first MHT was after a pregnancy loss required PPT. In addition, over 99% of women with a history of MHT one year prior to their first pregnancy loss required PPT after their first live births. These findings reveal that pregnancy loss (natural or induced) is a risk factor for PPT, and that the timing of events and the time span for considering prior mental health in research on pregnancy loss can significantly change observed effects. Clinicians should screen for a convergence of a history of MHT and prior pregnancy loss when evaluating pregnant women, in order to make appropriate referrals for counseling.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Incidence for depression increases during the perinatal period. Risk factors for depression may differentially affect each time period. Objective(s): To assess demographic, psychological and obstetric risk factors that differentially affect prenatal and postpartum depression Methods: A total of 169 subjects participated. Assessment was conducted during the first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, within a month after childbirth, and a month after childbirth. Demographic and obstetric measures, as well as psychological measures, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were conducted. Multiple regression and the Mann-Whitney U test were performed to examine the association between variables and depression scores. Result(s): Depression score was higher during the postpartum period than the prenatal period. Younger age was associated with depression during the first trimester. In the second trimester, less education, a history of depression and having stress within a year significantly affected depression scores. Smoking, artificial abortion and lack of support from family and parents correlated with depression during the third trimester. Within a month after childbirth, psychiatric and depression history, smoking, stress level within a year and lack of family support were associated with depression. At a month after childbirth, those who were primiparous and not breastfeeding had significantly higher depression scores. Conclusion(s): This study identifies various risk factors for each gestational and postpartum period and suggests differential interventions for different perinatal periods.

AB  - Introduction: Drug use is highly prevalent among female sex workers (FSWs). Some forms of drug use, such as injecting drug users (IDU), put them at greater risks for HIV and blood born disease (BBD). In this study, the pattern of drug use and its related factors among Iranian FSWs were investigated. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed based on the data of the integrated bio-behavioral surveillance-III (IBBS-III) on FSWs in 8 cities of Iran using the respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method conducting in 2019-2020. Of the 1515 FSWs participating in the IBBS-III study, 1,480 answered questions about drug use. To calculate the prevalence of drug use lifetime and in the past month, weighted analysis was used. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the factors related to drug use. Results: The prevalence of lifetime drug use and the prevalence of current drug use (single and poly drug use) among FSWs were estimated to be 29.3% and 18.86%, respectively. According to multivariate regression analysis, the odds ratio (odds) of lifetime drug use showed a statistically significant association with lower education (AOR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.3), being a direct sex worker (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.21-2.61), working in team houses or hangouts (AOR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.10-2.06), a history of intentional abortion (AOR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.07-1.87), condom use in the last sex (AOR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.19-2.17), a history of imprisonment (AOR = 3.05; 95% CI: 2.25-4.14), HIV positive tests (AOR = 8.24; 95% CI: 1.66-40.9), alcohol use (AOR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.29-2.29), and finding sexual clients in places such as parties, shopping malls, streets, and hotels, or by friends (AOR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.01-2.12). Conclusion: Given that drug use among FSWs is about 14 times higher than that of the Iranian general population, it is imperative that drug reduction programs be integrated into service packages. Specifically, prevention programs should be prioritized for occasional drug users within this population as they are at a greater risk of developing drug use issues compared to the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abortion behaviors among individuals with mental disorders presented major obstacles to women's health. However, few studies reported the prevalence and associated factors of abortion among women with severe mental disorders in China. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the prevalence of abortion among female patients in rural communities and identify potential health risks., METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 276 women aged 18years and older with severe mental disorders in rural areas of Shandong Province, China. The pregnancy history, abortion history and socio-demographic characteristics of women were investigated by questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the associated factors for different abortion behaviors., RESULT: The study showed that 82.61% (228/276) of patients had a pregnancy history. Among the patients with a pregnancy history, 43.42% (99/228) reported having had at least one abortion, and 15.79% (36/228) had more than one. In the other side, 31.58% (72/228) of them experienced spontaneous abortion, while 12.72% (29/228) experienced induced abortion. Age at first gestation (aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.90) and age at last gestation (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07-1.27) were both associated with abortion. Anxiety was related to spontaneous (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15) and repeat abortions (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19). In addition, religion (aOR 10.47, 95% CI 2.81-39.01), number of children>=2 (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.77), and family functioning (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.63) were associated with induced abortion., CONCLUSION: Women with severe mental disorders in rural regions have notably higher rates of abortion compared to the general female population, particularly for spontaneous abortions. Gestational age and anxiety of pregnant patients deserve attention and preventive measures to avoid the outcomes of abortion. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Well-being before and after pregnancy termination: The consequences of abortion and miscarriage on satisfaction with various domains of life
AU  - Huss, Björn

PD  - 
AB  - The consequences of pregnancy outcomes other than live birth on subjective well-being have rarely been analysed in research to date. This study examines pre-event determinants as well as the temporary and long-term effects of induced abortion and miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) on satisfaction with various domains of life. The data were derived from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam). The longitudinal sample consists of 5331 women of reproductive age, of whom 214 women had an induced abortion, 331 women had a miscarriage, and 1156 women had a live birth during the observation period. First, pre-event measures of women who had an induced abortion and women who had a miscarriage were compared with the pre-event measures of those women who gave birth. Second, fixed effects models were used to examine whether overall or domain-specific life satisfaction changed following a pregnancy termination. The results show that pregnancies resulting in abortion or miscarriage were less frequently preceded by pregnancy intentions compared to those resulting in live birth, and that induced abortion—but not miscarriage—was furthermore accompanied by lower pre-event satisfaction than live birth. Following both miscarriage and induced abortion, women experienced temporary declines in overall life satisfaction and showed persistently lower satisfaction in several domains of life. With regard to induced abortion, pre-event measures were a better predictor of overall well-being than the consequences of the event itself. Low life satisfaction might therefore be a risk factor for having an abortion rather than a result. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: About 10% of Indians have common mental disorders (CMDs) which include depression and anxiety. These disorders are common in women, which not only impacts on their quality of life but also their family members. The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of CMDs, and factors associated with them among women residing in coastal Karnataka. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 980 women aged between 18 and 60 years from 2019 to 2021. Women were administered a baseline questionnaire along with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire-7 (GAD-7) and Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4). Data were collected using Epi-info and were analysed using SPSS version 15.0. Association between CMDs and socio-demographic, reproductive health and behavioural factors were expressed as crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The prevalence of CMDs among women was 5.7%, with 4.6% having depression and 3.37% with anxiety disorders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that residing in urban areas (OR = 2.15; 95% CI:1.10–4.17), having a chronic illness (OR = 2.38; 95% CI:1.14–4.97), history of recent bereavement in the family (OR = 2.20; 95% CI:1.02–4.75), early marriage (OR = 2.63; 95% CI:1.09–6.33), history of abortion (OR = 2.89; 95% CI:1.42–5.92), and exposure to domestic violence (OR = 3.08; 95% CI:1.14–8.33) were significantly correlated with CMDs in this sample. Conclusions: The study revealed that CMDs were prevalent among the surveyed women, which calls for routine screening of women for CMDs in primary care settings for early identification and appropriate interventions. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background. Unwanted pregnancy can affect the sweet experience of motherhood and put a person at the crossroads of abortion or childbirth unaware of how each choice can affect a person's mental health, especially anxiety and depression. This study aimed to compare the rates of anxiety and depression between two groups of women with the experience of induced abortion and unwanted delivery. Methods. This research was conducted among 420 women with experience of unwanted pregnancy, including 210 women with a history of induced abortion and 210 women with a history of unwanted delivery. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were the main tools for gathering the related information. We collected demographic information, including marital status, age, number of children, occupation, and level of education. The associated data was analyzed based on an independent t-test using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software 19. Results. The results showed that the rate of anxiety among women with a history of unwanted delivery was higher than those with induced abortion. Although there was no significant difference in depression between the two groups, most subscales of depression such as feelings of failure, dissatisfaction, guilt, self-blame, suicidal ideation, crying, apathy, indecision, feelings of worthlessness, impotence, changes in sleep patterns, irritability, changes in appetite, difficulty in concentration, fatigue, and sexual apathy in the group with a history of abortion were higher than the group of women with a history of unwanted delivery. In addition, the rate of anxiety and depression was higher among single women with experience of induced abortion than married ones (P<0.05). Conclusion. According to the results, different levels of depression are more likely to occur among women who experience induced abortion under the influence of cultural, social, and religious factors. On the other hand, the level of anxiety among mothers who choose the path of childbirth in the situation of unwanted pregnancy is higher due to the responsibilities of parenthood. Furthermore, the relationships out of the formal marriage in traditional societies like Iran are taboos and do not meet social acceptance; so single mothers have to abort secretly without having the right to choose. This coercion can explain the higher rate of anxiety and depression among single women with a history of induced abortion than married ones. Practical Implications. The results of the present study can be used in the field of applied research and the development of preventive and therapeutic protocols and cover a large number of mothers and infants affected by anxiety disorders and depression due to unwanted pregnancies. © 2022, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.

The cases were 340 adolescents discharged from 3 hospitals in Santiago; 113 were due to proven induced abortions and 227 were spontaneous. The controls were 340 pregnant women who delivered. Interviews with psychiatrists and the Spielberg anxiety test and the Alvarado depression test were applied in the hospital and in the offices by trained professionals. Through these tests, greater anxiety was detected in adolescents with induced and spontaneous abortions and greater depression in those with induced abortions. Greater pathology and a higher frequency of psychiatric symptoms not constituting pathology were found in adolescents with induced abortions. Of those who had psychiatric pathology, the most frequent were: adaptation reactions and depressive episodes. There was a positive correlation between the findings of anxiety and depression through the tests applied and the presence of psychiatric pathology.;

AB  - Objectives: To test the association between having an abortion and subsequent depression, in a nationally representative and longitudinal dataset, controlling for pre-pregnancy depression. Methods: Data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health were utilized. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to test the relationship between having an abortion and subsequent depression. Analyses included women who had experienced unwanted pregnancies that ended in abortion or birth. All models adjusted for pre-pregnancy depression, race/ethnicity, childhood family structure, relationship status, educational attainment, income, age, and experience of child abuse. Results: Among women who had only experienced an unwanted pregnancy between Waves II and III, those who had abortions did not have a statistically significant increase in the odds of subsequent depression at Wave III compared those who gave birth. Among women who had only experienced an unwanted pregnancy between Waves III and IV, those who had abortions did not have a statistically significant increase in the odds of subsequent depression at Wave IV compared those who gave birth. In both models, pre-pregnancy depression was the strongest correlate of subsequent depression. Conclusions: In a nationally representative, longitudinal dataset, there was no evidence that women whose unwanted pregnancies result in abortion were at increased risk of subsequent depression compared to women who give birth after unwanted pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Miscarriage and induced abortion are life events that can potentially cause mental distress. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the patterns of normalization of mental health scores after these two pregnancy termination events. METHODS: Forty women who experienced miscarriages and 80 women who underwent abortions at the main hospital of Buskerud County in Norway were interviewed. All subjects completed the following questionnaires 10 days (T1), six months (T2), two years (T3) and five years (T4) after the pregnancy termination: Impact of Event Scale (IES), Quality of Life, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and another addressing their feelings about the pregnancy termination. Differential changes in mean scores were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and inter-group differences were assessed by ordinary least squares methods. RESULTS: Women who had experienced a miscarriage had more mental distress at 10 days and six months after the pregnancy termination than women who had undergone an abortion. However, women who had had a miscarriage exhibited significantly quicker improvement on IES scores for avoidance, grief, loss, guilt and anger throughout the observation period. Women who experienced induced abortion had significantly greater IES scores for avoidance and for the feelings of guilt, shame and relief than the miscarriage group at two and five years after the pregnancy termination (IES avoidance means: 3.2 vs 9.3 at T3, respectively, p < 0.001; 1.5 vs 8.3 at T4, respectively, p < 0.001). Compared with the general population, women who had undergone induced abortion had significantly higher HADS anxiety scores at all four interviews (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), while women who had had a miscarriage had significantly higher anxiety scores only at T1 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The course of psychological responses to miscarriage and abortion differed during the five-year period after the event. Women who had undergone an abortion exhibited higher scores during the follow-up period for some outcomes. The difference in the courses of responses may partly result from the different characteristics of the two pregnancy termination events

AB  - ObjectiveTo examine whether a first abortion increases risk of mental health disorders compared with a first childbirth with and without considering prepregnancy mental health and adverse exposures, childhood economic status, miscarriage history, age at first abortion or childbirth, and race or ethnicity.MethodsA cohort study compared rates of mental disorders (anxiety, mood, impulse-control, substance use, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation) among 259 women postabortion and 677 women postchildbirth aged 18-42 years at the time of interview from The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication.ResultsThe percentage of women with no, one, two, and three or more mental health disorders before their first abortion was 37.8%, 19.7%, 15.2%, and 27.3% and before their first childbirth was 57.9%, 19.6%, 9.2%, and 13.3%, respectively, indicating that women in the abortion group had more prior mental health disorders than women in the childbirth group (P&lt;.001). Although in unadjusted Cox proportional hazard models, abortion compared with childbirth was associated with statistically significant higher hazards of postpregnancy mental health disorders, associations were reduced and became nonstatistically significant for five disorders after adjusting for the aforementioned factors. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals dropped from 1.52 (1.08-2.15) to 1.12 (0.87-1.46) for anxiety disorders; from 1.56 (1.23-1.98) to 1.18 (0.88-1.56) for mood disorders; from 1.62 (1.02-2.57) to 1.10 (0.75-1.62) for impulse-control disorders; from 2.53 (1.09-5.86) to 1.82 (0.63-5.25) for eating disorders; and from 1.62 (1.09-2.40) to 1.25 (0.88-1.78) for suicidal ideation. Only the relationship between abortion and substance use disorders remained statistically significant, although the hazard ratio dropped from 3.05 (1.94-4.79) to 2.30 (1.35-3.92).ConclusionsAfter accounting for confounding factors, abortion was not a statistically significant predictor of subsequent anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and eating disorders or suicidal ideation.
